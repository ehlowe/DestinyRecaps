So the answer, the factual answer that I'll give to you, but it's not gonna change your mind or any conservative mind. Cause you don't care, is the big issue that we have right now with immigration. The huge issue that we have right now is the fact that you can walk up to the border and claim asylum. That's the big issue right now. The reason why it's impossible right now for the government to do anything is because of the laws on the books. If an immigrant comes up to the border and they say, we want to seek asylum, you basically have to cut them a ticket and say, okay, well, here's your hearing. It's in like two years because we've got like a 2 million, 3 million cases backed up right now.

I need the border to remain open until election day because conservatives don't care about the country. They don't care about the health of any of the people here.

That the reason why the numbers have grown so much and the reason why the apprehension rates have grown so much like it used to be, that I think you'd only catch like, 50 or 60% of the people crossing. And that number is in the nineties now. And I think the reason why that number is so high is because I don't think as many people are trying to cross illegally, they just go up and they seek asylum. Let me see if I can find this. It was in research subs. Immigration. Fuck. What did I feel like I had a link saved here for this. There are no limits on the number of individuals who may be granted asylum each year, nor are there categorical limitations. Ordinarily, for us immigration policy, we restrict the number of people coming based on certain countries being overrepresented or we have hard cap. But the asylum process, there is no cap.

How do you cap asylum? It's not known, actually, if you can cap asylum too. That's another challenge for international law reasons and for us law reasons, anybody here's a good heuristic when it comes to immigration as well. When somebody wants to talk about issues at the border and they give you one number and they build their, and they build their entire argument off of one number, they probably don't have a good understanding of anything relating to immigration. CA because all of these numbers are like, dependent on other things, and they vary for a variety of reasons. So, for instance, looking at apprehensions at the border doesn't necessarily give you a good key into what's happening, because apprehensions going up could mean that less people are coming in, or apprehensions coming up could mean that just more pe\",\n",

But there are more people as an absolute value that are coming in, or apprehensions going up or apprehensions going down, for instance, could mean. So I believe these are the numbers recently. Somebody can fact check me, look at this if you wantong. But I believe, like right now, I think the apprehensions on everything aren't as relevant right now, even as a percentage of the people that they think are crossing. Because, again, people aren't trying to cross illegally, and people aren't being apprehended across. They just walk up and they claim asylum. So even if those numbers are going down, CA because I think right now, I think we're apprehending, historically a very, very, very high percentage of the people trying to come over, but it doesn't matter because they just claim asylum, and then you're kinda like, fucked.

       "   \"true, why is the border control so anti Biden? I assume they don't run asylum at all. I don't know. I'd have to find out what the reasons why. It might just be. Traditionally, like, a republican supporter, there is one policy that, there's one policy that Biden changed that I think Trump had a better policy on, and I think that was called, I think it was the remain in Mexico thing, where I think in the United States for a while, if you came to seek asylum, while you waited for that to process, I think you had to wait in Mexico while it'processed. But I think overall, the amount of asylum seekers that that influenced coming over, I think ended up being. It was like 50,000. I don't think it was a big amount, but that would be, like, one thing that I think is probably better. Did I write anything on this? No. Fuck. You should look more into remain in Mexico.

Why did Biden step down? I think it, well, one of the things that I said, I always say this when people talk about, like, because people ask me, like, oh, talk to the keys for the election guy. What about this? That this predicts everything? People always say, like, XYZ predicts everything for the election. You get these things, you win the election, or this has mattered, or this hasn't mattered.

Do you think that Kamala'presidency will live up to Biden's. I have no idea. Who knows? For the next four years, nobody knows what they're going to look like. I think it's obvious why asylum is not capped. It should be people running from persecution. But as you mentioned, the issue is an enforcement sorting out who's legit. Yeah, I mean, like in a perfect world, but again, you can't even have these conversations because Republicans are deranged. But in a perfect world, asylum shouldn't be uncapped, right?

That if you want products, if you want goods and services that are made in America that aren't imported for anywhere, you're going to be paying a higher price for it.

It is supposed to be, but everything's power has its, like, like, like cons to it. Right. Like the legislature absolutely, undeniably has the most power, but it also, like, requires the most, like, inertia to overcome. Yeah. In order to get that power executed. Right.

The branches are separate and they're all important, but Congress is always intended to be the most powerful branch. It'the one that can amend the Constitution. It Corre, in theory, got the final hand on top, like you said.\\n\\nDestiny: And you have to remember that for Marb E. V. Madison, the Supreme Court was supposed to be the final say on resolving disputes for cases that would either come up federally or to resolve disputes between states or to resolve disputes relating to, like, treaties. I think that's what the Supreme Court was supposed to do. And it was onlyial review. Yes. The Supreme Court technically. Wait, what?\\n\\nC: I disagree with that reading that the Supreme Court, like, usurped itself.\\n\\nDestiny\",\n",
       "   \": Well, hold on. I saying, I'm not saying it usurped itself. I'm just saying that I't, it wasn't originally written, at least by text, that the Supreme Court had the power to declare a law from the legislature unconstitutional. That s, that's tr, that it can, because I think there were some, I don't remember quote, but some of the people that were originally, when they were driving the constitution didn't think that Congress would ever do that. Well, Congress wouldn't pass a law that's unconstitution. They can't. Or that. So, yeah, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nC: Here's my response to that real quick. I mean, you could imagine them coming up with something that said, it is emphatically the providence duty of the legislature to say with the laws instead of the judicial branch.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nC: I understand that, that it's not explicitly written, but if you read the federalist papers, there's a reference to judicial review in one of them.

Interesting.\\n\\nC: You not like\",\n",

Isn't that what Robert said, that we have to, or was it Alito that said that? No, it was Robert that wrote that opinion. Congress didn't make a law enforcing equal protections from the 14th amendment. And I thought that's what section five said. That's the argument that we use to get rid of section threeing legisl, saying that. Yeah, that was, that was like the. I believe that was the central argument that they used to say that the states can't enforce us yeah, that was what Robert said.

So they're just like they're paying taxes sometimes into systems and then they don't actually get anything back for it because they can't access any of those like welfare benefits or anything else. So they just end up.\\n\\nD: Or the fact that, like, if we think about, if we understand that the welfare state is mostly a system to help non workers, which is definitively the case, our two biggest pieces of welfare spending that we do, like half the federal budget or some crazy percentage, you know, 40% of it is just Medicare and Soci\",\n",

And so those people pay into systems more so than they take out of them because welfare is not a system to give poor people money. It's a system to give non workers money. And so you let in a bunch of workers, you're going to be able to fund your systems a lot better. So the fiscal arguments have obviously always been pretty crazy. Like some conservatives will say, oh, well, what about all the kids that go to public school? It's like, yeah, but those kids are fiscal multipliers, right?

Marbury is probably the most famous Supreme Court case that granted the Supreme Court the ability to have judicial review, which gives them the ability to take a law from Congress and say, this law doesn't comport with the Constitution. So we're going to strike down this law, right? We proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government.

The manner of constituting. It seems to embrace these several objects. First, the mode of appointing judges. Two, the tenure by which they are to hold their places. Three, the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other.

And then when the agency is created, the president of the United States has the ability to appoint the head of an agency. For the big ones, this is called his cabinet, are composed of these people, and the heads are called their officers. The president, unless Congress says explicitly authorized, the president has the right, granted by the Constitution to appoint or to nominate for appointment an officer the head of an agency or an office. And then with the Senate, we'll confirm that. And then that's where these agent heads come from. Right? Or officers. Right. I don't think we usually call them officers anymore. We call them cabinet members or we call them the heads of agencies, but, yeah. Second. And they're saying, well, we've already talked abo\",\n",

According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior, which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions, and among the rest, to that of this state. Its propriety, having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection. Which disorders their imaginations and judgments. Damn. Wait, who wrote like 70? What did we read before? Who wrote federal paper 70? Hold on. This. Okay. Damn. Okay.

And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws. So a lot of the federalist papers, they talk about, like, the british system, they talk about monarchies, and in here they're saying, well, a strong judiciary, it can protect a prince from anything, and it can evenect.

Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive that in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution, because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can \",\n",

So here they're saying that, like, well, we shouldn't be threatened by judges in terms of how they can attack us, because the judiciary basically can only hold the executive to account and prevent the legislature from doing wacky shit. They can't. The judges are neither executors of power. Nor are they writers of legislation for power. Right. The simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.

But that would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments, saying that. So a judiciary that stands on its own. Should never threaten liberty. But a judiciary aligned with one of the the other departments. Would be a grave threat. Which makes sense, remember, because up here, he said that a judiciary could protect a corrupt prince.

And in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security. So, arguing that because these other two branches are so politically beholden. That the judiciary should stand as lifetime appointments. Essentially because it insulates them from the political pressures of Congress or the executive right. The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution.

A bill of attainder is a law that punishes a person or group without a judicial trial. Okay, okay. And the like. So this is saying that a limited constitution is one that even the legislature is not allowed to pass, a law that would arrest people with no due process or pass laws that would criminalize past behavior, that you would now be held criminally liable for. Right.

It is urged that the authority from it is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the american constitutions, a brief discussion. The ground on which it rests cannot be accept, cannot be unacceptable. So some people argue that, oh, well, fine, if the judiciary can just nullify anything from the legislature, it must be superior to the legislature. And Hamilton says, just because you can say that an act coming from them is void doesn't mean that you have more power than the people passing the act. So that's not true.

If you delegate it, you can't. Something that's contrary to the tenor of the commission would be void. You can't have the constitution granting something to the legislature, and then the legislature defies the constitution, then the defiance would make whatever that act isoid avoid act essentially right.

And that the construction that they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered that this cannot be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. Whenever you see the word construction, I believe that construction refers to the idea of deciding whether or not a particular thing is in concordance with the thing that authorizes it, with the law that authorizes it. So when you talk about statutory construction, you're talking about a judiciary system reviewing a thing or somebody reviewing a thing saying, does this comport with the law? I think that's statutory \",\n",

That would be a statutory construction. So this is saying you can't allow the body passing laws to do statutory construction on their own. That would be ridiculous, because then they could pass whatever they want and decide whatever they pass is legal. They'd have no check on their power there. It is not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to sub substitute their will to that of the constituents. It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact, and must be regarded by the judg\",\n",

Or in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people, to the intention of their agents. So basically saying that, like, if there's a disagreement between what a judge would say, Congress says versus what the Constitution says, the Constitution is not federal law. Okay, I kind of argued with this. I don't know what a law professor would say. This is a feeling that I have. I could be wrong. If there's a federal or if there's a constitutional law wants to disagree, feel free to let me know. But, like, I don't think it'you, shouldn't conceive of the constitution as federal law. It's not.

And if you have an irreconcilability between a federal law and the Constitution, the Constitution is always preferred, because you're not comparing one law to another. You're comparing the supreme law or the Constitution to a statute or law passed by the Congress which gets its power or authority from the Constitution. Right? And they're saying that obviously it's the judiciary that makes these decisions. Nor does this conclusion, by any means, suppose the superiority of the judicial to the legislative power.

Right. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by those which are not fundamental. Constitutional law versus statutes passed by Congress this exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two contradictory laws is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation, so far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconci',\n",

They stand a direct opposition. Right. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the last, in order of time, shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing.

So obviously saying that a court should rule in concordance with the superior governing authority, even if an inferior one disagrees at a later point in time. It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature.

The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals. From the effects of those ill humors which the arts of designing men or the influence of particular conjectures, sometimes conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the meantime to occasion dangerous innovations in the government and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community.

Right, though I trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness.

The legislature should not have the ability to do that. The judiciary will hold firm and do their constitutional interpretations as such. And if the legislature really wants to fight the constitution, they need to change the constitution. They can't put themselves above it. They have to change it.

My assumption is going to be if Biden stepped down, then he definitely was speaking to the party about it. So if he was speaking to the party about it and party leaders, there's probably a conversation about who to nominate. And there'now, there should be, there should be a coherent and consistent plan moving forward.

As of now, this is conservatism 101. So the answer, the factual answer that I'll give to you, but it's not gonna change your mind or any conservative mind. Cause you don't care, is the big issue that we have right now with immigration. The huge issue that we have right now is the fact that you can walk up to the border and claim asylum. That's the big issue right now. The reason why it's impossible right now for the government to do anything is because of the laws on the books. If an immigrant comes up to the border and they say, we want to seek asylum, you basically have to cut them a ticket and say, okay, well, here's your hearing. It's in like two years because we've got like a 2 million, 3 million cases backed up right now. The legislation that was originally written by Senator Linkford, that was proposed in the House that Democrats and Republicans initially were supporting, we're going to increase the amount of funding, increase the amount \", \"of judges available for asylum processes, increase some funding for border security, cap potentially the maximum number of asylum seeking per day if it exceeded a certain amount. This was supposed to deal with the asylum seeking problem. But the issue is, Donald Trump called up the Republicans. And none of what I'm saying right now is because'all open. We watched Ted Cruz talk about this. Donald Trump basically made a call and said, you guys can't support this. I need the border to remain open until election day because conservatives don't care about the country. They don't care about the health of any of the people here. They only care about holding on to power right now. So the Republicans pulled their support from the bill. Again, we watched Ted Cruz say, even before he read it, he didn't support it. And now after he's read it, he definitely had doesn support.\\n\\nD: Right.\\n\\nDestiny: But they all pulled this work from the bill because nobody wants to backstab Daddy Trump, because Trump\", \" will destroy your career as he's done to multiple politicians in the past. And all Republicans want Toa talk about when it comes to border security, is building the wall and building the wall and making the wall taller and helping border security. But it doesn't matter right now. You don't need a wall. It's not doing anything because people aren't sneaking into the country, people aren't tearing down the wall, they're not climbing over. They're just going up to a border patrol person and saying like, hey, can I see asylum o? You have to accept me. Thanks. Give me a ticket. I'm gonna go hang out in here while I wait for my case. And then boom, you're done. You cana have the most Terminator T 7000. Whatever fucking wall you want. It doesn't matter. Re just gonna walk up to a border agent and seek asylum. That's the big issue right now. That's why shit is so fucked right now. But yeah. Thoughts on Alan Lichmans election model? The bindn dropped out. I don't do much with the twelve keys g\", \"uy. I've heard him talk about it before, but the, hold on, l something he's on. I think when he talks about the key thing, he says that as long as it's Kamala running, that they can still inherit, like the incumbent key or something else. But you just paraphrase this quote from, is it Sartre? Is that, do you proonounced his name about antise Semites and applied toertativeers? Yeah, that's the quote that I had in mind. Congratulations. Why is it that over the, all of a sudden, over the last decade, we're hearing about the seeking asylum thing? Did something change on his question? I don't know. Actually, when I was doing my immigration research, I never looked up that question. Maybe I should. I don't know what changed significantly because it seems like this vulnerability was always open. Maybe just nobody knew about it. Nobody was taking advantage of it. Destiny, if what you're saying is true, then why would anyone illegally cross the border? Wouldn't that be close to zero people? The\", \"y could just go to border crossing. My understanding is that's basically what's happening now. That the reason why the numbers have grown so much and the reason why the apprehension rates have grown so much like it used to be, that I think you'd only catch like, 50 or 60% of the people crossing. And that number is in the nineties now. And I think the reason why that number is so high is because I don't think as many people are trying to cross illegally, they just go up and they seek asylum. Let me see if I can find this. It was in research subs. Immigration. Fuck. What did I feel like I had a link saved here for this. There are no limits on the number of individuals who may be granted asylum each year, nor are there categorical limitations. Ordinarily, for us immigration policy, we restrict the number of people coming based on certain countries being overrepresented or we have hard cap. But the asylum process, there is no cap. It's so broken. Hold on. Oh, shit. It might be this. No, fu\", \"ck. This wasn't what I was looking for. Like, when people, if you're going to talk to somebody about border stuff, here's one thing. Here's a heuristic that I would apply. How do you cap asylum? It's not known, actually, if you can cap asylum too. That's another challenge for international law reasons and for us law reasons, anybody here's a good heuristic when it comes to immigration as well. When somebody wants to talk about issues at the border and they give you one number and they build their, and they build their entire argument off of one number, they probably don't have a good understanding of anything relating to immigration. CA because all of these numbers are like, dependent on other things, and they vary for a variety of reasons. So, for instance, looking at apprehensions at the border doesn't necessarily give you a good key into what's happening, because apprehensions going up could mean that less people are coming in, or apprehensions coming up could mean that just more pe\", \"ople are trying to come in, so more apprehended. But there are more people as an absolute value that are coming in, or apprehensions going up or apprehensions going down, for instance, could mean. So I believe these are the numbers recently. Somebody can fact check me, look at this if you wantong. But I believe, like right now, I think the apprehensions on everything aren't as relevant right now, even as a percentage of the people that they think are crossing. Because, again, people aren't trying to cross illegally, and people aren't being apprehended across. They just walk up and they claim asylum. So even if those numbers are going down, CA because I think right now, I think we're apprehending, historically a very, very, very high percentage of the people trying to come over, but it doesn't matter because they just claim asylum, and then you're kinda like, fucked. Your ignorance on this topic is absurd, and you should switch topics. Oh, okay. No doy. My bad. If what you're saying is \", \"true, why is the border control so anti Biden? I assume they don't run asylum at all. I don't know. I'd have to find out what the reasons why. It might just be. Traditionally, like, a republican supporter, there is one policy that, there's one policy that Biden changed that I think Trump had a better policy on, and I think that was called, I think it was the remain in Mexico thing, where I think in the United States for a while, if you came to seek asylum, while you waited for that to process, I think you had to wait in Mexico while it'processed. But I think overall, the amount of asylum seekers that that influenced coming over, I think ended up being. It was like 50,000. I don't think it was a big amount, but that would be, like, one thing that I think is probably better. Did I write anything on this? No. Fuck. You should look more into remain in Mexico. It was illegal, inhumane, and ineffective. Oh, if I recall, the current international asylum agreement is called the Dublin Protocol\", \". Yeah, but I mean, technically, the US does have its own laws, so we could technically make laws and contravention of international stuff, although that's probably not a good idea for a variety of reasons. But that sounds like a very big deal, though. The way to Mexico were saying in the US until your case. Yeah, but I don't think it caught that many people. I don't think that many peopleeah. Why did Biden step down? I think it, well, one of the things that I said, I always say this when people talk about, like, because people ask me, like, oh, talk to the keys for the election guy. What about this? That this predicts everything? People always say, like, XYZ predicts everything for the election. You get these things, you win the election, or this has mattered, or this hasn't mattered. And then I've always said, but one of the reasons why I don't care about these things is that they matter until they don't. So historically, and I think we've even enjoyed about on stream historically, d\", \"ebates actually haven't mattered at all. Or rather, they don't change the needle much, except for when they do, I guess so. Like, for Kennedy, Nixon, I think they might have. And I guess for this election, probably. I think that everything that's happened has just been a response to that one debate that Biden had on stage with Trump. That would be my guess. Do you think that Kamala'presidency will live up to Biden's. I have no idea. Who knows? For the next four years, nobody knows what they're going to look like. I think it's obvious why asylum is not capped. It should be people running from persecution. But as you mentioned, the issue is an enforcement sorting out who's legit. Yeah, I mean, like in a perfect world, but again, you can't even have these conversations because Republicans are deranged. But in a perfect world, asylum shouldn't be uncapped, right? Like, let's say that there was some, like a cartel got, ah, hold of a nuclear weapon and they are announced that they're gon toa\", \" nuke fucking Tijuana or some shit. And like 50,000 Mexicans want to flee across the border and seek asylum for a month. Like that should probably be okay. The problem though, is that you're getting a lot of people probably. I wonder if there's. Is there a link to like, what are the asylum case approval rates? It feels like based on. This is just like news and shit I've read. I guess I haven't looked at these number numbers, but it feels like people are just seeking asylum ca because they just want to immigrate to the United States. They basically come up, they're like, hey, I'm seeking asylum because they just want to immigrate here. And it's like, okay, well, that's not really what that process should be used for. Percentage of asylum cases granted. Destiny. A guy ended his campaign after saying yeah, too enthusiastically at a rally. Fuck. Who was that? Was that Rick Perry? It wasn't right. Oh, fuck.

But everyeah, every country, every nation, every people are all susceptible to things like fear or whatever else. Did you see turkey Toms video on your recent stuff?

The problem with Hillary is, I think Hillary was definitely a. It was definitely like a straw breaking the camel's back. There were a lot of ways that she probably could have won, but there were just so many other things that were kind of working against her. Republicans had been making Hillary, like, the key focal attack point for what, like, a decade. Republicans had just constantly been trashing Hillary, and there were so many weird, stupid conspiracies that Republicans and alt media people were in charge of, like, spreading as much as possible. People don't even remember all the crazy conspiracies. You remember. There was the Seth rich guy that, the Clinton kill list. You remember PBD? Is he iranian? Did somebody tell me this like this? You were very eloquent on the way you defended Hillary Clinton on who she was.

You know, Mary Mahonia, former White House intern, was murdered July 1997 at Starbucks coffee shop Inor Vince Fost. Vince Foster was the next one. The jamesg was keep Usash. Ron Brown is another one. But there was a close person to this bigger racer. You got Paul Tley, Ed Wooley. You're reading a list of people that Bill and Hill Knating questionswer. No one wants to make Trump a king. Why did you speak such nonsense? Because conservatives want to make Trump a king. They don't trust the judiciary, they don't trust Congress, and they don't trust most of the executive branch. They want Donald Trump to have all the power and they want him to be above approach as evidenced by the previous criminal immunity decision that they supported in the Supreme Court. People want Donald Trump to be able to unilaterally create and execute law in the United States and to be beyond judicial review for said creation and execution \", \"of laws. That's how conservatives see Donald Trump. He is a king figure to them, an emperor figure that is above the law. Harry Parks Jane Bunch James Wilsongus Bill Shel Fors Martin Susan Coleman, Paula Grber, Danny Caolo, Paula Wilker, John Walker, Barbara Wise. We should verify this. Yourus your ra should St. Barry Beal Barrry seal read URL. Read most there was this fuck, I don't even remember all the Hillary conspiracies. Do you guys remember uranium one? This one sticks out to me because it was one of the ones that ended up researching. This was like when I was just getting involved in politics. So I didn't do too much reading, research. Everything but theanium one, this uranium. One thing was when conservatives were claiming that Hillary Clinton unilaterally sold all of our nuclear uranium to Russia so they could build nuclear we webs killos. There were so many crazy conspiracy theories. Then you had the whole Benghazi hearing where conservatives were basically saying that it was\", \" Hillary Clinton's fault that an embassy got hit and we didn't have like enough protection for it. At a point in time, people were saying the whole email thing. We talked about for years and years, the Hillary's emails. There was Comey coming out and making statements to the public about the investigation. That was a scathing review of Hillary's in the state Department use of emails. Like, there was just so much, there was so much wacky shit that any one of these things that they hadn't had happened, maybe Hillary would have won, maybe not, who knows? But yeah, read about her. I read about that in her autobiography, but I never really figured out why they made her public enemy number one, if I had to guess. I'm floating on very. I'm treading on. You can't tread on ice. Treading on thin ice. I'm skating on thin ice here. Oh, yeah. Pizzaate. Holy shit. True. I think that the issue is that the Clintons were a very effective political institution. Like, the Clintons were good at, I think, \", \"like, fostering talent, supporting the party, like doing advertising was helping. Like, the Clintons were just a good political institution and the conservativeators had to take it down. They had to like, destroy that. And so they became the focal point of their taxer. Yeah, pizzagate was insane. The podesta emails where people were trying to go through and code these as like, oh, this is, this means, what was it like? Like this particular thing.\\n\\nD: Oh, fuck.\\n\\nDestiny: I wish I could remember some of the coding they had. It's like when you asked to go out for drinks on like a Friday night. Friday refers to female and drinks refers to like, double anal and this refers to child. And they were all sending coded messages through emails. It was like, bro, what? Yeah, it was fucking. It was so unhinged. My God. Do you think rite people being mad about free trade policies from Obama? Clinton played a role as well as into Hillary's defeat? It's possible, maybe, and republicans played well int\", \"o that. But again, like, it's hard because as a Republican, God, you can just see so much stupid shit. Only a Republican can get away with running. They re the same candidate, they just was president for four years with the same slogan of saying, make America great again. Yeah, but like, conservatives will promise you contradictory things and people don't even realize how stupid people like the ask are. So for instance, people will complain about inflation. I don't like inflation. I don't like the things cost more. And then people will say, I support made in America. And it's like, you understand these two things are directly contradictory, right? That if you want products, if you want goods and services that are made in America that aren't imported for anywhere, you're going to be paying a higher price for it. This would contribute to inflation, right? The things like tariffs on other countries to make their goods more expensive to import are going to cause inflation, right. Directly.\", \" These two things are directly at ends with each other. Do you think that conservative talking points wereublicans to the party that freed the slaves, actually helped secure black votes at all? No, I don't think so. I don't think anybody's fooled by that. Why not? Both? Destiny? I genuinely don't understand. The reason why we import goods and services from other countries is because they're cheaper. That's why we do it. Obviously. Right? You save money. If younna advocate for made in America and you wanna start tariffing or making those goods and services more expensive to import, then what happens is for whatever particular thing you wantna buy, you're gonna be paying more money for it. So a shirt that would have cost you $10 because now it's made in America, it might cost you dollar twelve, but you're supporting Maden american things. So that's like, you can support made in America if you want. You have the right to do that, obviously. And you might even think it's a good policy for \", \"a variety of reasons, but it's gonna mean that things are gonna be more expensive. There's a trade off there, you know? Is that inflation? Bro just said things costing more is inflation. What do you think inflation is? M one, m two. Money, not price point. Oh, my bad. I don't know. I was talking to a crypto libertarian. True. It's not like the CPI or anything like measures inflation or we get our year over year inflation numbers or anything based on like cost of average cost of goods in a basket or whatever, right? I think it just, I think it's literally just the money supply. And then they copy paste that into an excel sheet and then it spits out inflation numbers. My bad. What about terrorf on things'ramping? Up production of domestically like chips or semiconductors for domestic consumption. The problem with tariffs is if you're going to use a tariff, you have to understand what a tariff is for, what the purpose of what you're doing with it is. If you're using a tariff for something\", \" like, we'll say semiconductors, the reason why you're doing it is because you feel like manufacturing semiconductors at home is essential to national security. That's it. Not because you're doing it for good economic policy. Chances are if you manufacture them at home, it's going to cost more, it's going to be more expensive, and that's a whole bunch of other knock on effects for when you make things more expensive. But that's it. Don't fool yourself into thinking that tariffs are good econ policy, they're used for other purposes. If somebody tells you they're doing it for good econ policy, they're lying to you. The conflict in Ukraine may be clear cut, but I don't think you have a solution for it, or at least I didn't hear it. And how to prevent a similar thing from happening in the future? Again, answers for it would stem from history. Clearly. Full destruction of Putin cabinet like it might happen with Hamas is unrealistic. And even if it happened somehow, who's to say a worst gove\", \"rnment would rise? I have a solution for those things, and I learned it from my israeli studies. Oay what needs to happen is there's two things that need to happen, okay? One is the United States needs to not have a schizophrenic foreign policy. You need to have an idea about what direction your country needs to head into, and you need to be consistent and clear to the world about that. Right. So this is our future with Iran and Russia. We'ren to be clear, this is what we expect, and then we're gon toa be consistent. Even if the administration's change, we're gon to roughly remain on the same path. That's number one. All. Number two is there needs to be immediate and heavy corrective action when somebody contradicts us. Will, if you fuck up, you will get fucked up. Full stop. No negotiations, no red lines that we don't respect. No bullshit. It needs to be incredibly aggressive, and it needs to be swift, and it needs to be precise, and it needs to be like, clearly tied to the violation \", \"of a particular thing, and that should be it. And I feel like, I feel like if America had that type of international presence, I think that it would instill more world order. I think even though it seems hawkish, I think it would lead to a more peaceful place. Are read about seeing russian influence where there isnt any. Some of your comments on the post on the subred are getting Lex were getting a little unhinged. Yeah, it might be overshooting a bit right now. I think a lot of the accounts that I thought on Twitter that were bots, they just act like bots. I think theyre probably just like gripers because they do a lot of gayops and shit on Twitter and create a ton of accounts and post. Or it might be a combination of, like, people posting on accounts and using them as bots. I think I should focus less on the bot part, though, and more on the disinformation part, because whether or not they're bots isn't actually the point. The point is whether or not people are engaging with social m\", \"edia in bad faith, with the effect of just fostering dissent. That's really the more important part. It doesn't really matter if they're bots or not, because it could be people. It'really be the exact same thing. I do wonder im so curious on a lot of this stuff.

Wait, how many comments are on this fucking tweet? Fuck. I thought there were a few good ones that were, like, try to post, like, five bot baits and check for patterns. I don't even know if you could identify any at this point. Or the problem is that u. Wait, hold on. I'll explain the problem in a second. Wait. Fuck. I wonder if a couple of these got deleted. If they got deleted, it might be because they were humans and they realized that they responded too quickly. Or not. A native speaker. Could recess be understood as a break from work? Maybe? I guess. Just buy what Ryan Macbeth uses, bro. 12,000 a month. Fuck that. We had this thing that we, like, fixated on so much.

I don't actually know if bots blew pass the Turing test. I don't know if bots blew pass the Turing test. Or if human engagement on social media just dramatically fell below the Turing test. I't. I'm not sure, because I guess when I look at stuff posted on social media, I'm not really thinking like, man, is this a really sophisticated bot?

Conservatives believed that Hillary Clinton and Podesta and other democratic leaders were meeting in the basement of a pizza parlor that didn't have a basement and were coming together to perform satanic blood rituals to rape children and extract their blood to extend their youth. I'm not joking. That was the belief. And I believe people like Marjor Taylor Greene legitimately were posting on Facebook about this because they legitimately believed it to be true. Oh.

You actually made me paranoid, though. True. Why are big lefty content creators not going hard on conservatives? They seem radio silent on everything. The issue is that people are mistaken. People look at a binary here, and what they look at is they see, they'll see like democrats, they'll see republicans, and then as you go further and further and further along this axis down here, they'll see like communists and socialists or whatever, right? And then like for this, for republicans, you've got, like, the alt right, Nazis, fascists, whatever, right? I think the issue is that it's this binary here or this line segment. Like, you can only plot people on it when they believe in, like, the concept of liberalism. As soon as you become illiberal, you've moved completely off of this and you're not mappable onto this anymore. And, no, I don't mean like, oh, yeah, that's when we use this thing, is it? No, you don't. You're. Yo\", \"u're something that is fundamentally different. Even if you do agree with some policies on the left and right. For a Democrat or Republican, if you're a communist or a fascist, like, it doesn't matter. You're something markedly different. So when you look at people like, like, I would broadly say that you've got kind of the second axis, this illiberal axis. I've called it anti establishment, but I really think it's just anti liberalism. And when you're on this axis, right, so on the far, far left you've got, or on the left side, you've basically got, like, progressives, and then further left you've got, like, communist socialists, and then on the same axis, you've got, like, magitards, and then barely to the right of them, you've got, like, fascists or whatever. These people are in another world where they're looking to create, like, authoritarian establishments. They're looking to create things that are where they can enforce their will with very little democratic influence, with the \", \"ability to oppress and suppress opponents, political opponents, to have, like, strong men leading the way. Like, this is kind of what you're looking for here. These people exist in a far different world than these people. So when you say, why is it that people on the far left aren't attacking the Republicans? Well, for a lot of it, they don't even necessarily disagree with them. Right. Far left people, illiberal people are gonna line up with other illiberal people when it comes to things like protectionism, isolationism and foreign policy. Right. They're all kind of, like, in the same basket. Like, very far right. Like, fascists and communists will agree. Yeah, we do need to protect our own population. Yeah, fuck NATO and fuck Ukraine and fuck, why are we wasting money on this week? Spend money. Our own people. Like, they're gonna be in perfect alignment with a lot of these talking points.

You could have Governor Shapiro at a Pennsylvania.\\n\\nDestiny: Does drawing a governor from here put at risk having another democratic governor in one of these states? For Shapiro or Whitme?\\n\\nB: That's a good question. So I don't know how it works in those states, like Kentucky, which is the state I lived in before North Carolina, the lieutenant governor and the governor are elected on a joint ticket. So for Kentucky, you have Andy Bashir, who is also, his name has been thrown around too. He's a Democrat. And his lieutenant governor, whose name escapes me, she was elected with him kind of like the president, vice president. But in North Carolina, where I live now, you have a democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and an insane republican lieutenant governor who was elected separately. So to your point, or I guess one of the\", \" questions raised is like, if you pull one of these democratic governors, the, presumably the lieutenant governor would be the one who automatically takes their place. Right. And I don't know anything about the lieutenant governors in those states.

Why do we care about, what's the big concern federally for republican governors is that they would have, like, a large influence over the state legislatures when it comes to things like, like gerrymandering or how they do votes for elections or the governors don't have any influence on the federal level aside from, like, how voting is done, right?\\n\\nB: Correct. Yeah. So governors have, like, no federal duties or anythin\", \"g like that. But if you have. So, like, Pennsylvania, for example, they have, I think they have a bicameral state legislature, and I think they're both now in the hands of Democrats. But a republican governor would be able to veto, you know, legislation, stuff like that. And so you could imagine a situation where a democratic state legislature would want to make it easier for people to vote and a republican governor would have it in their vested interest for that not to be the case.

It wasn't a phone call with his AG. It wasn't a phone call with his deputy AG, and it wasn't his phone call with any of the investigators in the FBI. It was his personal legal counsel. That was a personal phone call that he was making to try to get them to give personal voter information to his campaign. His personal stuff.

The phone call was on January 2, the Rapensurger phone call. So.\\n\\nB: And Bill Barr served. O yeah, Bill Barr was gone by December 23. So I can't remember who took his place. But, you know, most of the people, like, built Barr is a good example of this because he obviously opposed everything that Trump said. So that's probably another reason, you know, if, even if he wanted to enlist, you know, Justice Department officials. I can't imagine many would co sign the shit that Trump was alleging. But what's interesting is, though, again, you make a point. He's operating in his capacity as a private citizen. But can you imagine the fucking pressure that Raffensberger and Kemp felt?

He had no chance until I showed up and I helped him. And the people of Georgia are gonna be very mad. So there were three different times on that phone call where he alluded to, you're gonna lose your next elections, guys. Cause I'm not gonna be helping you.

Everybody's like, dude, we've looked into all of this. It is bullshit. I'm sorry, right? The CeISA head guy ended up, I think, stepping down. I think Trump forced him to resign eventually. Barr resigned. Crbs ye, yeah, KBS, yeah, because Barr resigned is like, fuck this, this is retarded. Right? So Donald Trump has an acting right because none of these people are confirmed by the Senate. He has his acting attorney General Rosen, he has his deputy acting attorney General Donahue. And then there is a guy who is, there's a guy who works as an attorney in the, what is it? It's like the environmental protections part of the DOJ, right? Oay, Donald Trump goes to Donahue and Rosen and Donald Trump is like, hey, I got an idea. Can you just like send letters to these seven states and tell them that we found really good evidence of voter fraud and we're still investigating it. So you guys kind of need to like toss your election for now and like, mayb\", \"to lie. Right. People need to know this, okay? It's not the same on both sides. Both sides did not do these. Right. The republican playbook is insane. It's unhinged. That was Rudy Giuliani's defense. He said I lied, but that's my first amendment right to lie. And then he lost that case for $148 million. Like, it's insane.\\n\\nB: Yeah, and then, and then he tried to declare bankruptcy and the judge threw it out too. There's a, there's a.\\n\\nDestiny: Because they lied about his assets. He tried to do chapter eleven, right, so he could restructure. Then he tried to convert it to a chapter seven so that he could wipe away all his debt and just hold ono a couple assets. But then he lied about money that he was making other businesses. Fuck Giuliani. Fuck these crooks. Literally. Crook.\\n\\nB: That's America's mayor, baby. That was, that was the heir apparent of the republican party back in 2001. He was the future. No, I mean, you're right. Listen, I totally agree. The asymmetry, that's something I \", \"complain about a lot of my channel, and it's something that represents a long term problem and risk to this country that we have to break. Like, you know, I understand that people are spending a lot of time, I don't want to say woke scolding you, but like calling you out for some of like, the incendiary shit that you said. But to me, I think the sentiment behind it, like, hey, if we're going to have a good faith conversation, it has to be recip ##ated and we have to hold both sides to the same standard because that's the only way you can ever accurately evaluate anything, is by holding it to the same standard that you do the other things. That is a major issue, and we're not going to be able to progress as a country, in my opinion, until we make serious strides towards it. But getting back to the phone call thing that you mentioned, you said that it was a private citizen calling with his attorneys. And what's so interesting about that, though, is obviously Trump wasn't doing that in hi\", \"s capacity as present because the president has absolute, plays no role, none, in the peaceful transfer of power. And cor, you know, those things.\\n\\nDestiny: And let me say further oay that because people might argue this, it's inarguable. Okay. When Donald Trump called Raffnberger, he had with him his personal legal counsel. Yeah, Mark Meadows was there as well, his chief of staff, but he was his personal legal counsel. It wasn't a phone call with his AG. It wasn't a phone call with his deputy AG, and it wasn't his phone call with any of the investigators in the FBI. It was his personal legal counsel. That was a personal phone call that he was making to try to get them to give personal voter information to his campaign. His personal stuff. That was not a phone call that was made in the capacity of the president of the United States and any size, shape, or form.\\n\\nB: But, yeah, do you remember, I'm trying to think who was attorney J was, did Barr retire at that time? Because I can't reme\", \"mber the timeline. The phone call, it was either late 2020 or early 2020. 1 Bar Bill Barr may have already stepped out at that point, but, yeah, I mean, like most of his I.\\n\\nDestiny: Can track real quick. The phone call was on January 2, the Rapensurger phone call. So.\\n\\nB: And Bill Barr served. O yeah, Bill Barr was gone by December 23. So I can't remember who took his place. But, you know, most of the people, like, built Barr is a good example of this because he obviously opposed everything that Trump said. So that's probably another reason, you know, if, even if he wanted to enlist, you know, Justice Department officials. I can't imagine many would co sign the shit that Trump was alleging. But what's interesting is, though, again, you make a point. He's operating in his capacity as a private citizen. But can you imagine the fucking pressure that Raffensberger and Kemp felt? Because, yes, he's doing it as a private citizen, but he's also simultaneously the president of the United Stat\", \"es and to get that phone call from your party leader and the, the most powerful man on earth who is operating so nakedly.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, hold on.\\n\\nB: Serving.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, you don't have to imagine. There are three separate quotes on that call where he talks about how these guys ran. I think he ke. It was one of these. Yeah, Kemp ran. He was the loser. He was a schmuck. I think he called him. He had no chance until I showed up and I helped him. And the people of Georgia are gonna be very mad. So there were three different times on that phone call where he alluded to, you're gonna lose your next elections, guys. Cause I'm not gonna be helping you. And there was a time on that phone call where Donald Trump, who is the head of the executive branch, who, who is the. Sorry. Who'arguably. Appoints the head of the Justice Department, the Department of justice, who does investigations, is saying things to him about how, hey, by the way, this is criminal. And you know what's happening here,\", \" right? Yeah.\\n\\nB: And, and now, years later, you get a Supreme Court ruling which says that any potential correspondence that a future President Trump would have with a future attorney general who is not like Bill Barr, for any sort of sham investigation that would result from that, to, like, punish a disloyal republican governor, you can't probe that. That's absolutely immune, and you couldn't probe that. I mean, to me, the decision today, which I don't know how you feel about it. I am curious how you feel about Biden's decision to step down. I've been agnostic about it. Like, I didn't celebrate this decision, nor was I dreading it, because to me, the stakes are the same and the outcome is the same in the sense that I don't care who the fuck. Like, they could run. They could run a dog. You know what I mean? Like, they could just, like, it could be air Bud, the president version. And I would still vote for that person, try to make a compelling case for it, because you just. Trump has t\", \"o be defeated. I imagine that's where you are, too. I imagine there's probably not a Democrat in office, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, that you would not squarely sit behind to beat Trump. Is that how you feel?\\n\\nDestiny: That I would, yeah. Well, I'd say yeah. I mean unless before, but somebody'going to post now. Well, what about this Democrat who actually is pro launching all the nukes and he's like the fucking state assembly. Right. But in general, yeah, I think I probably agree. Yeah.\\n\\nB: Do, how do you feel about the decision of him? Drop it. Like personally because you'been, they joke that you're Biden strongest soldier but I mean you've been an outspoken, supportive, you've defended his presidency as a iy. And how do you feel about his decision to drop out? Do you care?\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, I think I've said it over the past week. I'm just like, my biggest issue is for people that talk about the dropout. They pretend that the path forward is so easy after he drops out and I\", \" don't, I think it's super variable. I think it could be really good, it could be really bad. My opinion is the exact time as it was yesterday. I think that he had to drop out though because it, it's pretty obvious that like a lot of the party wants him to drop out. Right. There's so much stuff getting leaked to the media that's not happening on accident. They're trying to apply a lot of pressureeah.\\n\\nB: Do you? Well, I agree. I think that this was, I went live very briefly just a few minutes ago and then Conoboy joined and like I said, I'm agnostic about it. I saw a risk no matter what and there was data to back up either decision. And even this decision is risky. I mean, he has officially endorsed the vice president, but he also weeks ago said his delegates could vote for whomever they want. I imagine most if not all of them will go over. I don't know if you saw this though. Republicans are threatening and have been threatening for weeks when it looked like this might happen to put u\", \"p legal challenges to try to block any. I don't know what their basis would be or whatever, but my gu, you.\\n\\nDestiny: Know, would be the ultimate, you know what, here's what I will say. Ready?\\n\\nB: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Hold on. M trying to think if I want to commit to this, make a strong statement about leaving the country, don't do it. No, don't. If they were to throw up some legal challenge in some state saying that Biden can't be removed to the ballot or that like the Democrat can't be added to the ballot and the Supreme Court would have hold that. I think I would bounce if that happened, I think I would bounce or I can't say it because I'm on YouTube, nevermind. I would bounce. I would just leave by there. That would be unbeieable. That would be unfathomable. And I can see Robert'doing it. I could see him writing that opinion. Could Oromas Thomas writing the majority opinion. Okay. Is gonna explain why it's actually really important that Biden not be removed from the ballot and con las c\", \"an be added to the ballot.\\n\\nB: It'd be div all rightna, I'm gonna play the devil's advocate. Cause I m see, I'm not seeing your chat and I don't this, I agree with you that this is perfectly possible, but what do you say to people who inevitably, on Twitter and on Reddit and maybe even in DGG, say, stephven, you're just catastrophizing. There's no way, given the stakes, that even Roberts would make a decision like, you know, the democratic candidate, the democratic nominee can't be added to the ballot because it's like past the deadline or whatever. There's no way they would take it that far. You would say.\\n\\nDestiny: You know the story about the lobster boiling in the pot, right? I don't even know if that's how they actually die. But the issue is when things happen that are crazy, you only really know that retrospectively. Like, it's hard to see crazy things happening as they happen. I think that we're already way past crazy shit happening, but because it's also gradually done and beca\", \"use we're inundated with so much news, you don't really perceive it. I think crazy things have already happened that are unacceptable.\\n\\nB: Agreed.\\n\\nDestiny: So, I mean, why would it not continue? What you're basically saying is, aren't you catastrophizing by thinking that the country'going to head in the exact same direction that it's been heading, that the guy who's runiting for president, who's the most self serving person who's ever been president, would continue to be self serving head in that, like, did you read, I've read so much. I hate the vibe, Vance. I just want toa play video games and be a shitp poster.\\n\\nB: No, dude.\\n\\nDestiny: Did you read the full, did you read, did you read the full back and forth? Everything that happened with Clark, Trump, Rosen.\\n\\nB: And Donahue was which one was one of them? Mike Pence's attorney or chief of staff?\\n\\nDestiny: No. Okay. This wholesome, any one of these is all of this is insane. But any one of these things on their own is insane. It shoul\", \"d be, I say, impeachable, but I think, like, criminally prosecutable. Okay? Keep in mind, and I also want you to keep this in mind. Don't ever fucking forget this, okay? Keep this in mind. Okay? Have your permanent recorder turn on right now. Everything I'm about to tell you you will never know about again, ever. Because now this is all beyond criminal review. So you would never get a probe, you'd never get an inquiry, you'd never get subpoenas, all of this would. Beyond criminal review. Okay? So everything I'm about to say, you'll never hear about this again if a president tries this, all right? Remember that. Cause that's what the conservatives want, that's what the court wants, and that's what the six conservative justices on the court signed off on, okay? Or at least five of them. Donald Trump, Oay was mad that Barr wouldn't co sign his bullshit opinion about the election being stolen, right? Donald Trump is going to every person in his government trying to say, hey, can you please\", \", like, guys, the election was stolen, right? Everybody's like, dude, we've looked into all of this. It is bullshit. I'm sorry, right? The CeISA head guy ended up, I think, stepping down. I think Trump forced him to resign eventually. Barr resigned. Crbs ye, yeah, KBS, yeah, because Barr resigned is like, fuck this, this is retarded. Right? So Donald Trump has an acting right because none of these people are confirmed by the Senate. He has his acting attorney General Rosen, he has his deputy acting attorney General Donahue. And then there is a guy who is, there's a guy who works as an attorney in the, what is it? It's like the environmental protections part of the DOJ, right? Oay, Donald Trump goes to Donahue and Rosen and Donald Trump is like, hey, I got an idea. Can you just like send letters to these seven states and tell them that we found really good evidence of voter fraud and we're still investigating it. So you guys kind of need to like toss your election for now and like, mayb\", \"e we'll come back to it, we'revisit in a few weeks. And obviously Donahue and Rosen are like, no, this is fucking retarded. We're not going to do this. And Donahue and Rosen are, you know, they're like, they're chilling, you know, they're on their bed kicking their feet up, you drawing pictures and hanging out and doing whatever attorney generals and deputy attorney generals do. And this guy Clark starts, like, wandering into their office, you know, like chatting with them, like, hey, guys, what's up? Yeah, do you guys think that we should do, maybe we should, maybe we should do something about this Trump stuff? Or, you know, maybe we should actually tell the states that there's some fucked up shit. And they're like, wait, how the fuck do you even know this? Why the fuck are you even. And then Trump starts mentioning Clark's name. And now they're asking him, like, why is Trump mentioning your name? Why the fuck does Trump even know who the fuck you are? What the fuck? And he's like, we\", \"ll, you know, me and Trump, you know, we go way back by like three days. So we've been having conversations. And at some point, Clark, because Trump is asking his deputy and his attorney general over and over again, he's like, can you please write these bullshit letters? One day, Clark comes up to Donahue and Rosen and Clark says, hey, can you guys promote me? Add somebody andter me so my ran is more impressive? And then can you sign this letter? And Rosen and Din here look at it. And the letter is. Is what Trump wants them to say, right? It's the lie of like, oh, yeah, we found big voter fraud. Can you guys toss your election out? And both of them are like, we are never signing anything like this. And then Clark is like, okay, that's fine, but u, you know, maybe I'll be the attorney general next. And then that part.\\n\\nB: Yeah, that part I recall where he basically says, this is their subordinate, basically saying, if you don't do this, I'going be, I'm going to be your replacement.\\n\\nDes\", \"tiny: Yes.\\n\\nB: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: And all of this culminates in one of the funniest. God fuck. There'you've, got the j six committee report of it, which is insanely epic and hilarious. No, it's an epic confrontation. But then you've got Hirschman's deposition where he, where he's recounting this. And all of this culminates in this crazy event where basically Donald Trump is gonna fire the attorney general and he's gonna install Clark as the attorney general, who has no background in any. He never done a criminal case life. Okay? So that Clark will send out this letter to all of the states, the swing states, and then flip their votes. And so Donahue, fuck, it's like seven different people. But Donahue, rose and a bunch of other people all go to the Oval office, they start contacting everybody in the DOJ, okay? And then they go to Trump, and they all have this conversation. Just so you know, like, half of your state department or half of your DOJ is about to resign, okay? If you're seriousl\", \"y gonna replace us. Clark is giving the most impassioned speech in his world, arguing why he should be the attorney general. Hirschman is here, like, shouting him down as a fucking retard. Hirscshhman's like, what are you planning on doing when you become attorney general? And Clark's like, well, I'm gonna write this letter and do that. And then Hirschman is like. He's like, oh, so you've never heard of, like, you know, what is it? Like, rule 63? You understand you're gonna commit a felony day one, right? Like, maybe you should go back to the DOJ, and when we have, like, a question about oil spills, we'll call you. Like, Hirschman is saying all of this in his deposition, and it's this insane fucking play of, like, crazy shit. This one thing in and of itself is just insanely unhinged and crazy, right? This is just one of, like, 15 different unbelievable things. Did you know that there was a leaked phone call of Donald Trump calling the election fraud investigator in Georgia? He's callin\", \"g her and a six minute call. And he's like, hey, just calling to say that I know you're a great person and you're doing great work, and I know you're gonna find the voter fraud that we're looking for. Good luck. Right? Why is he making that? Why is he even have a number?\\n\\nB: There's one I want toa make sure I get the state right, but I think it's Michigan. And this broke, like, within the past six months. But you had Trump, and then you had the Ronald McDaniel, Mitt Romney's niece, and she was the head of the republican national Convention at the time. And until recently, they were also calling, calling election certifiers as well. Like, people are on the boards of these election commissions, asking them to basically walk back their votes to certify Biden's victory in that particular state. I'm pretty sure it was Michigan. So he did it apparently in multiple states. I forgot about the Georgia one. Yeah, I mean, the shit's crazy. It really is. In any of these individual things. You know\", \", like Steve Bannon, one of Trump's advisors, said that, you know, you got to flood the zone with shit. And they've done it so well, because to your point, any of these things, if they were given just adequate media attention, would potentially kill a political career of any politicians and should, right and, you know, even in today's media environment, you could just scratch out the names and the circumstances and just put Biden in. And even in 2024, even though the people, the media'gotten. Used to Donald Trump, this same story with the same set of facts would destroy any Democrat.\\n\\nDestiny: These are the things. Yeah. Oh, my God, bro, I read the 160 page. Most of these are slides. Have you actually gone over all of the Dominion presentation of the.\\n\\nB: Not the whole thing. There was. There was the court filings, which prior to the.\\n\\nDestiny: Go, bro. The Dominion shit. Hold on, I'm gonna send you this. You can read through some of this in your free time. It ISU. I asked a chat. I wa\", \"s like, is there like a log of. I just want to see some of these leaked.\\n\\nB: You're talking about the leake texts and stuff like that? Yeah. They were released in court filings, I think, piecemeal. I don't even think it was in just one court, one filing until later on.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, but, yeah, there is. There is a whole thing. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Sorry. Keep going. I'm gonna find this.\\n\\nB: No. Yeah, I mean, they were absolutely damning. And that's another thing, too.\\n\\nDestiny: No, no, no, wait. Hold on. I'm so sorry. Just because. Because you're underselling everything. Peaceco's been underselling everything. I've been underselling everything. Okay. We've all been underselling everything. Okay. They're not damning. Okay. These are beyond dead to rights. Okay? If you ever get bored, all right, you should go through. I don't know who. The attorneys that they hired for this, bro, this is.

No.\\n\\nDestiny: Fox News, they have an entire fact checking department that works really hard. Every single exec at Fox News and every single host at Fox News knew that they were spreading bullshit. They knew that they were spreading lies. They were admitting all of it in the background, but they were also admitting that we're losing our viewers to Newsmax. We have to have them on. We've got to bring these people on. Meanwhile, like, all of them saying shit like, what was it? There was one in here where it was, like, Sidney Powell, I think yesterday. She was on, like, ketamine, mushrooms and LSD. There's no way. Like, this bitch is fucking crazy. Like, literally, it is insane how much is. They knew theyew.\\n\\nB: And not only it would be bad enough if it were just from the Tucker Carlson's and Laura Ingrams or whatever, but you even had I'm pretty sure Brett Baer, who is supposed one of their, Chris Wallace, straight news journalist, like even he was in on it too. Like, hey, maybe we shou\", \"ld call this thing into question in order to get vote, to get viewers share back. I mean, it's poisoned the entire network. And the other thing too, just to kind of capitalize on this. When the Dominion text dropped and obviously it was a bombshell, it went off one of the points that I was making. You want to talk about the double standards in the asymmetry. Obviously media networks get shit wrong. There's no question. Obviously there are probably times where they have, they have knowingly spread misinformation. And the thing is though, what sets Fox apart here is we have no evidence of like CNN. Like people talk about like we'll see then what it did to the Covington Catholic kids.\\n\\nDestiny: No, careful. There's one thing at every conservative there are any left of my chat I haven't banned yet'going, to bring up. And it's the. Is it, was it Donna Brazil they handed debate questions off for a Democrat primary?\\n\\nC: That was in secret. Stepven, it's the opposite of what you're talking abo\", \"ut. We're talking about public lies to the people. That was a secret backdoor.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, sure. No, but I'm just saying that like in terms of like them picking and choosing a candidate and being biased or whatever, that's the one that.\\n\\nB: No, no, no, I'm sorry. No, no. I'm sorry. To be clear, to be clear, I'm not even, I'm actually not making that case because I have no doubt that, you know, these journalists and these, you wouldn't call Laurie Ingram and Tucker Carson journalists, but like these pundits obviously have their biases. That's fine, right. That. I don't mind that Tucker Carlson is a pro Trump bias except for just on the merits of it. He's entitled to that for sure. But we have never seen something so pervasive and systemic and dishonest as the Dominion voting machines people say. Well, CNN, you know, with the Covington Catholics, the kids and the misrepresentation of that whole thing, there was nothing like this. Like they had to pay nearly a billion dollars, was lik\", \"e $787 million in the defamation suit. And peace. Was the attorney here? I'm not. But my understanding is it's really, really hard to prove this sort of defamation case in an America biggest of all.\\n\\nC: Time against a major news network.\\n\\nDestiny: Million millions, right. And that likeable, there were messages going around just as a quick one from Jay Wallace. And these are all people. This is the president, executive editor of Fox News Media. Right. Emails going around when they're talking. Okay. Jay Wallace sending a message to Suzanne Scott, who's another execrVp or something. Right. Thank you.\\n\\nB: She was their CEO.\\n\\nDestiny: I watched. I watched Lou closely for two weeks during the conventions. The North Koreans do a more nuanced show. Like, there are so many crazy emails and they're just talking about all of this. Yeah, all of this.\\n\\nB: And there's nothing like it that we have any evidence of from MSNBC, CNN.\\n\\nDestiny: The Twitter files had nothing like this, by the way. Right. A\", \"nd Mat Taii. Okay. The hack. Fuck. Loser. Even he said in his tweets, call you out, man. Even he said in his tweets that I saw no evidence of the government intruding to try to censor the laptop story. Zero evidence of any government intrusion on that, by the way. But conservatives will still repeat that lie over and over and over again. Right, right. And keep in mind also, hold on, hold on. I saw some conservatives type those. Keep this in mind. Cause they're lying. They're sneaky. Conservatives will tell you, oh, that's why I don't listen to Fox News, because I know they do fake news. No, they don't listen to Fox News because they wanted them to do more fake news. That was why they left Fox News. And that's why Fox News was lying about this, is because they were losing their audience to Newsmax and Oan. And they say it over and over again, we're losing viewers to Newsmax. They're taking it and. But they even say because they know that these are lies and bullshit. Okay. Between Peters\", \"on and Schreierier. Okay, I turned it off. I don't know how we work here, honestly. We're gonna look back at this week and know that this is when we lost a significant part of our audience who won't come back as soon as Facebook starts telling people to go to Newsmax. You know, though, between us, this is a problem for the channel. Yes. But if we keep doing what we do, FBN will get a bunch of the disenfranchised folks, too. They're talking about people leaving because they want broadcast fake news, by the way. 100%. I was talking about exactly that with my husband last night. It's actually an opening for us. Yes.

I believe that in our current conception, the Supreme Court of the United States is effectively the most powerful branch, not equal, but is the top dog of the three. What do you think? Am I wrong?\\n\\nDestiny: Just, it'hard to say. Like, what? There are so many checks and balances between them all. It just hard to say. I don't know if I would say any branches, like, technically I believe conceptual. I think Congress is supposed to be kind of the most powerful, but it is. It is supposed to be, but everything's power has its, like, like, like cons to it. Right. Like the legislature absolutely, undeniably has the most power, but it also, like, requires the most, like, inertia to overcome. Yeah. In order to get that power executed. Right. The Supreme Court theoretically can wield a lot of power, but it's kind of constrained theoretically by the Constitution, like, in.\\n\\nB: Terms of what the founders intended. You actually find, like, the wo\", \"rd coeal doesn't exist in the Constitution. Right. And Jamie Raskin and other constitutional scholars have really been leading the way on this and really since Donald Trump became president, saying that, you know, the notion of three co equal branches, it's kind of a canard, right. The branches are separate and they're all important, but Congress is always intended to be the most powerful branch. It'the one that can amend the Constitution. It Corre, in theory, got the final hand on top, like you said.\\n\\nDestiny: And you have to remember that for Marb E. V. Madison, the Supreme Court was supposed to be the final say on resolving disputes for cases that would either come up federally or to resolve disputes between states or to resolve disputes relating to, like, treaties. I think that's what the Supreme Court was supposed to do. And it was onlyial review. Yes. The Supreme Court technically. Wait, what?\\n\\nC: I disagree with that reading that the Supreme Court, like, usurped itself.\\n\\nDestiny\", \": Well, hold on. I saying, I'm not saying it usurped itself. I'm just saying that I't, it wasn't originally written, at least by text, that the Supreme Court had the power to declare a law from the legislature unconstitutional. That s, that's tr, that it can, because I think there were some, I don't remember quote, but some of the people that were originally, when they were driving the constitution didn't think that Congress would ever do that. Well, Congress wouldn't pass a law that's unconstitution. They can't. Or that. So, yeah, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nC: Here's my response to that real quick. I mean, you could imagine them coming up with something that said, it is emphatically the providence duty of the legislature to say with the laws instead of the judicial branch.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nC: I understand that, that it's not explicitly written, but if you read the federalist papers, there's a reference to judicial review in one of them. Forgetting, I'm not remembering right now which one it i\", \"s. But also, there were other state supreme courts at the time that did have that authority. And the thought process is, and again, I don't have the analysis on hand that the inspiration for the federal judiciary were those other state supreme courts. And so I do think that as envisioned by the framers in the federalist papers, that judicial review is like considered.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, that could be the case. Considering that the Marbury case was like, was that like 1807 or something? How early was that? It was pretty early.\\n\\nC: It was an early case under 1803. Marshall. Sure. Yeah. It's a famous opinion and it's one of the most. If you look at the fact pattern, its one of the craziest opinions. Anyone who worries about like judicial ethics. Just so you guys know, this was all about a commission that wasn't sent to Marbury under the Adams administration by the secretary of state, was supposed to give away the commissions to these justices of the peace. And you want to know who the secret\", \"ary of state was at the time of the Adams administration who failed to send the commission to Marbury? A little felw by the name of Justice Marshall. And so, so why isn't Justice Marshall recusing himself in this case when he's like a fact witness of what happened? Who knows? There's a lot of that.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but the early courts and the supreme Court, everything was wild. It was way different. Yeah, it was a wild.\\n\\nC: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's just say it was a different time back then. And some people think it was a.\\n\\nDestiny: Setup case that set it up, even was it seems like case. The court has changed like quite a lot over the history of the United States. Not just ancient hist history either. Like I said, I was like setting aside an evening to read through that, the brown v. Board of education case. Because I was curious like what the argives are. That's like a, that's like an eleven page opinion. It's like a 20 minutes read. And I'm like, oh, okay. Interesting.\\n\\nC: You not like\", \" it. You're against Brown v. Board?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, because Congress didn't make a law. Okay. Congress didn't make a law. Right. Isn't that what Robert said, that we have to, or was it Alito that said that? No, it was Robert that wrote that opinion. Congress didn't make a law enforcing equal protections from the 14th amendment. And I thought that's what section five said. That's the argument that we use to get rid of section threeing legisl, saying that. Yeah, that was, that was like the. I believe that was the central argument that they used to say that the states can't enforce us yeah, that was what Robert said.

Donald Trump. Sorry, I messed it up. Joe Biden is not entitled to the infrastructure of his party. He has no, like, legal right to, or even like, philosophical right to use the resources of the Democrats and have democrats support him. Maintaining the confidence of your party is a absolute vital thing to do. In almost every democracy, certainly in every parliamentary democracy, there are methods to get rid of a leader who does not have the confidenc\", \"e of his party. In this specific case, there were a bunch of contests that occurred. Yeah. Millions of people voted in a private primary process that uses the kind of the systems of the state and it, and it's conducted by sometimes by state officials. But these are private contests, and there are rules attendant to those private contests, which are what happens if a candidate decides to drop out. It was entirely Joe Biden's decision to drop out or not, that there was pressure and people using their First Amendment rights to voice their lack of confidence in the president and his ability to be Donald Trump is totally par for the course. It's part of the rules. It's what happens, and there's nothing wrong with it. And suggest that we should be bound by those previous primaries. Supposing, and on the condition that Joe Biden decide to drop out is ridiculous, flatly ridiculous. Joe Biden has no entitlement to like the funding or the support. And the fact that that was starting to leave and\", \" that pressure, his decision doesnt make his decision to drop out any more illegitimate or anti democratic. The real election is in November and maybe even before that.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nC: If you're doing the early voteing intern, that kind of thing. And so that's the real election. This is all private and it was all done above board, 100%.\\n\\nD: Yeah. And I think one thing is well worth pointing out is that Biden, like Biden had a running mate, Kamala Harris, he alsot, like Peacecoast, said he voluntarily chose to drop out. And so now picking his backup candidate, which is basically what a vice presidential nominee is, doesn't seem particularly anti democratic. It seems like these institutions are set up to handle a scenario like this. So it's nothing worth worrying about too much.

It's truly showing the attempt to just try and throw shit at the wall and just hope that anything can stick because Kamala most likely is just not as polarizing a candidate as Joe Biden. And it's just. It is, like, structurally going to be more difficult. Tear her down.\\n\\nDestiny: They say that, but, like, Joe Biden, aside from the senility stuff, I guess after this last debate, was also, like, not divisive at all. Right? Notice that they hu\", \"ng on to that one picture of him in that one speech for the entirety of his fucking presidency, the one with the red. The red light behind him, the zoomed in one. And it was like, even if you listen to that speech, he's like, it's not all Republicans, guys, okay? Just the maga. The ones that don't support the election results are the threat to democracy, which they are. But, like, yeah, it doesn't really matter what you are. They'll invent or make them anything to attack you. It's unhinged.\\n\\nC: I got one other thing to say. One other thing to say. New York Times. New York Times. Get your shit together. New York Times. We did what your editorial board asked for. Get it together. Get on the team. We know what's going on.\\n\\nB: I hear it. Do you follow the New York Times pitch bot on Twitter, pleaseace? Go.\\n\\nC: Yeah, I do.\\n\\nB: That guy's fucking funny. And I haven't checked his page, but I imagine he's got some funny ones, too, of like, why Kamala Harris should also drop out for the sake of\", \" democracy.\\n\\nDestiny: Why?\\n\\nB: Hey, what, pet? Steven, did you ever watch the west Wing?\\n\\nDestiny: I've seen clips of it, but no, not. Never. Even a full episode.\\n\\nB: Okay, well, it is in its first three or four seasons. I do think it's one of the best tv shows in american history. It's really, really good. Wow. Aaron Sorkin, the guy who created the west Wing and, you know, some other, like, really good. Like, I think it was the newsroom or America's newsroom or something like that on HBO. It's really good. He. He's got a really good mind for tv. He wrote an op ed for the New York Times. Peaceco. Have you seen this one?\\n\\nC: Did he say we should nominate Mitt Romney?\\n\\nB: Mitt Romney.\\n\\nC: Sorkin. Get it together. Sorkin.\\n\\nB: Yeah, so, so. Steen. He's like, listen, people have been asking me how I would script the West Wing finale to this election because the West Wing is so idyllic and it's got a good faith Republican Party and, you know, an impeccable presence. It's just its political f\", \"antasy. And he said what the Democratic Party should do is persuade President Biden to withdraw. And then for the sake of unity, nominate Mitt Romney, a Republican, as the democratic nominee as a gesture of unity to unite the american people. Like, even this guy, who is presumably like a dyed in the wool liberal, thinks that they're so, they're so horny to appeal to Republicans that what Democrats should do is not elect a better Democrat or more electable Democrat. It's just to elect a different type of Republican. So in a way, as far as I'm concerned, this further reinforces what we've been bitching about here and what you've been bitching about here. Even. It's not just them. There are people on our side of the aisle who feel like we have to bend over. We don't just meet in the middle. We have to go all the way up to them and give them 90% of what they want.\\n\\nDestiny: And keep in mind, publicly, you never, ever, ever hear these conversations from conservatives. Well, hold on. Are we \", \"gonna lose the center? Are we gonna lose liberals on this one? And in the behind the scenes stuff, right, for the dominion, Fox News stuff, it's what lies can we tell so that we don't lose our conservative base to, like, even more further right publications. There's never a consideration of, like, well, are the moderates not gonna trust us anymore? Like, they don't even consider it. Yeah, they only bang the war drums on their side and attack the other. There's never a consideration for people in the middle there.\\n\\nB: Right. Did anybody prior to JD Vance being selected as Donald Trump's nominee think about this? Were there. Maybe I missed them. Maybe they were out there. Were there calls by major conservative figures or Republicans that Donald Trump should nominate? I don't know, fucking Chuck Schumer, you know, somebody like that, like a Democrat to try to appeal to the other. No, of course not.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, there were a lot of calls on Twitter that were very upset, to be fair, that\", \" JD Vance'wife was Brown. They did complain about that. True. I don't know how mainstream that got in the Republican Party. There's a. A lot of talk on Twitter over that. They really didn't like fact she was indian, but, you know. Right, right.\\n\\nC: Steven says a lot of talk on Twitter. He just means Nick Fuente, too.\\n\\nDestiny: No, there were a few really big tweets and a lot of discourse over it now. But I don't know. It wasn't like lawmakers. It wasn't like mainstay rolling parties. Also, I don't know, again, what I even trust on f. Twitter. But, yeah.\\n\\nB: Well, right.\\n\\nD: Realizes they reveal they hate indian women. We nominated an indian woman. It's perfect.

But Steven is still banned.\\n\\nDestiny: And sn. And also, I also, but I do want to say, finally, twitch resp\", \"ected me a little bit, and I do appreciate it that when Nathan was making threats against my life, he was the first person to get banned from twitch for making threats against my life. Not the actual guys.\\n\\nC: Wait, your son was banned?\\n\\nDestiny: Y. Not the other guys that were saying, when I see destiny, it's gonna be on site. Okay.

Why did this just become a thing? Why weren't people abus using this, like, ten years ago? Like, what? Did something significantly change about asylum seeking? Or why? Or did people just realize this or what?\\n\\nD: Mike, you know, this would be conjecture, but if I looked into it, I would assume that it would be because when Trump took office, he took such an incredibly hard stance on ille\", \"gal immigration that because illegal immigrants aren't, like, stupid or, or anything, like, they have. Like, there's clear strategies for immigrating to the United States in an undocumented sense that spread around to people who want to enter into the country. And my assumption would be that when Trump took office, there was an understanding that, well, hey, like, you can't really just, like, sneak into the country as easily as you used to. However, there is a legal process for claiming asylum that you can take advantage of in that circumstance. And that's where, like, the remainaining Mexico policies start to come in, where it's like, hey, if you have to. If you want to seek asylum, you have to stay in Mexico. This kind of thing. And so my assumption would be that's where it kind of started to, you know, be popularized. And maybe Covid has something to do with it as well. But, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of reform that probably needs to happen to the asylum seeking process. Like Alex \", \"Narsto, in conversation I had with him a long time ago, one thing that he pointed to was that, that the people perceive problems where there is chaos. And so even if the problem at the border is because of people taking advantage of a legal process, that because it causes chaos to have so many people coming into the country, they're going to perceive that as, like, a very chaotic and poor process. And so if all we did was just liberalize, like, work permits and allow people to come in in a more orderly process, instead of having them all stack up into one, you know, asylum seeking, a refugee process, that would probably lead to a lot less polarization on the border, because people just wouldn't see a chaotic process. They would just kind of, maybe there'd be some notion of, like, immigrants taking work visas. But that's like a much less like apparent problem than a bunch of people stacking up in an asylumt process.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. The problem is that like I feel like liberals don't hav\", \"e that strong of a position on immigration because it just seems like unsolvable, like it seems like nobody wants to come together to do anything and then conservatives don't have a coherent position on it either. So it's like, I don't know if there's any, nobody seems to know have, I don't think anybody even knows what they want immigration to the United States to look like. Conservatives seem to say they want nobody except for high skill workers, which is equally retarded as saying you only want low skill workers. All workers are valuable. And then all they say is liberals want open borders. But I don't know any poll that shows that liberals want open borders. That's like a fictitious position. Yeah. So, yeah, I just, yeah, immigration is a very annoying thing to, yeah, nobody has like serious, there's no serious conversations on it.\\n\\nD: I mean, I think it's, I don't know, it's, I guess it's similar to Israel Palestine where like you have said, you know, well, what's going to take wi\", \"th Israel Palestine is leaders who come together and are willing to concede things. And I think that in some regards take political hits for doing so. And I think that with the undocumented immigrant issue, I think what it's going to take is just some coalescence of political circumstance such that we create a seriously expedited path to residency for all of these undocumented immigrants and then probably reform the asylum process but also reform our broader immigration process so that if you're basically just an immigrant who wants to come and work here, that that's not like an impossible process. Because again, like when, you know, when conservatives talk about this problem, it's like, well, why are people choosing to go through the asylum process? Well, they're doing that because it's just the easiest way to come here and work for the most part. Right. It's not like immigrants have super easy access to welfare benefits or anything like that. I mean, you can look at, you know, how mu\", \"ch welfare immigrants take in and how much they pay into the systems. It's not really bankrupting us in any sense.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, not even bankrupting, I believe the last, the largest piece I've read on this, I think I, this link to my doc shows that counterintuitively illegal immigrants are either neutral to positive impacting on fiscal, on budgets. And the reason being is because like you said, oftentimes they have either fake Social Security numbers or none. So they're just like they're paying taxes sometimes into systems and then they don't actually get anything back for it because they can't access any of those like welfare benefits or anything else. So they just end up.\\n\\nD: Or the fact that, like, if we think about, if we understand that the welfare state is mostly a system to help non workers, which is definitively the case, our two biggest pieces of welfare spending that we do, like half the federal budget or some crazy percentage, you know, 40% of it is just Medicare and Soci\", \"al Security. Even if you were allow in, I.\\n\\nDestiny: Don'T know if I would say half. Isn't it like two thirds you're talking about? That's essentially all entitlement spending, right? Or is there entitlement spending that's not just Social Security and Medicare?\\n\\nD: The last I checked, don't we spend like about two to $3 trillion a year on both of those programs? And I think the whole federal budget is maybe five or $6 trillion.\\n\\nDestiny: Really?\\n\\nD: I'm not sure what is our discretion?\\n\\nDestiny: I thought that non disccretionary was like two thirds of the budget about, and then discretionary was like about one third, approximately.\\n\\nD: Well, nonetheless, it's a huge percentage, obviously, of our spending is just helping elderly people basically stay out of poverty. And when you consider that if you were to allow in all these immigrants, they necessarily wouldn't drain the system because they're all workers, they're working, right? They're not, they're not a bunch of old disabled peopl\", \"e who are immediately going to go on to benefits. They're prime age workers.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nD: Right. It's one of the reasons why people say, oh, immigrants are more likely to commit crime. Well, they're more likely to commit crime because they're younger, right? These are young working people. And so those people pay into systems more so than they take out of them because welfare is not a system to give poor people money. It's a system to give non workers money. And so you let in a bunch of workers, you're going to be able to fund your systems a lot better. So the fiscal arguments have obviously always been pretty crazy. Like some conservatives will say, oh, well, what about all the kids that go to public school? It's like, yeah, but those kids are fiscal multipliers, right? Because you invest in their education and then they become workers like they are't. It's not like kids just go from school to being immediately disabled and unable to work. Right? This is a huge misunderstanding\", \" of the welfare state. But honestly, it's probably not a misunderstanding. It's just an excuse to keep brown people out of the country. Right. It just. I think a lot of it just comes down to, frankly, just, like, racism. I think that a lot of conservatives who are super duper against immigrants, they just really don't, like, basically, like, non white immigrants coming into the country for the most part.\\n\\nDestiny: Right. Ye. It's really. It's just weird and dumb. And it's based on a lot of weird protectionist ideas that, like, immigrants will come in and even when our unemployment is at, like, 2.9%, they're still somehow, like, stealing all the jobs and Americans can't work. And it's just like. It's just dumb, unhinged. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nD: It's totally ridiculous. But anyway, yeah, I mean, overall, immigration is obviously a relatively big problem, but, I mean, what people have to keep in mind is that the only reason that America is a world s superpower is because of a liberal immigr\", \"ation policy. Right. I mean, imagine if, you know, to the white nationalists out there, like, imagine if America was only ever. Imagine if the only stock of people in America was only ever, like, the Anglo Saxons that, like, came over from the UK and we didn't have the huge waves of german, irish, polish, italian, mexican, indian, chinese immigration across. You know, we would be a country that would have, like, 25 million people and we'd be just as irrelevant as a country as, like, fucking Belgium or something.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nD: We wouldn't be a serious country without immigration. And so it's. It's obviously just a. It's. It's just a ton of fear mongering. But I guess it is funny that somebody named Nick Fuentes is super against.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. All of them. Yeah, they're very racially diverse.\\n\\nD: Ye, yeah, very diverse group of white nationalists.\\n\\nDestiny: They are. They are indeed. Ye.\\n\\nD: But good. What are you going to do?

I think most of the debates I've had where Myron is moderating, I think he heavily agrees with the other side, like in the rolo TMMSi one and the one with the Suli Mon guy or whatever. But I think he've just done a pretty fair job moderating at all of them. I don't think he's ever done anything wacky or stupid or ever. Yeah. Wait. Okay.

       " Segment(category='Analysis of Federalist Paper No. 78', color='orange', start_time=15173, end_time=17052, width=1879, x=0.9444082840236686, texts=[\"ed to read this real quick. I'm sorry. Because this up has to do with a judicial review. I guess I'm going to do anything else with Dan in about an hour. Just so you know. I'll be doing that. So I'm going to have to take off soon to go set up. But let's read this real quick first. Federalist number 78, the judiciary department. This would have been written in. These were all written in, what, 1770? What? Six through eight, I think. Oh, wait, 1780s. Oh, I'm sorry. I might have been. This one is 1788. Oh, damn. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. This was way later than I thought. My bad. Okay. All right, here we go. To the people of the state of New York, we proceed now to examine of the judiciary department of the proposed government. So, as a refresher, the federalist papers were a lot of the founding fathers writing to newspapers, making arguments for federalizing the independent colonies and everything to make a cohesive government, and then arguing about what the structure of that government shou\", \"ld ultimately look like under pseudonyms. The federalist papers are their writings that are being published. Okay, so the author for this one is Alexander Hamilton. We proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government and unfold. I'm reading this because supposedly this is a precursor to, or Pisco says there was good founding father justification for the judicial review that was granted in Marbury v. Madison. Marbury is probably the most famous Supreme Court case that granted the Supreme Court the ability to have judicial review, which gives them the ability to take a law from Congress and say, this law doesn't comport with the Constitution. So we're going to strike down this law, right? We proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government. In unfolding the defects of the existing confederation, the utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is the less necessary to recapitulate t\", \"he considerations they'urged, as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed. The only questions which have been raised, being relative to the manner of constituting it, and to its extent, to these points, therefore, our observations shall be confined. Okay, so he's saying, we all know that we need one. We're not going to argue whether or not we need one or not, but just more like, what should it look like? I think, is this okay? The manner of constituting. It seems to embrace these several objects. First, the mode of appointing judges. Two, the tenure by which they are to hold their places. Three, the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other. First, as to the mode of appointing the judges, this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in general, and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition. So, officers in the \", \"United States, in the federal government, under the executive branch, all of the different agencies are offices. So, like, the DEA is an agency, the DOJ is an agency, the EPA is an agency. Agencies are created by Congress, authorized by law. And then when the agency is created, the president of the United States has the ability to appoint the head of an agency. For the big ones, this is called his cabinet, are composed of these people, and the heads are called their officers. The president, unless Congress says explicitly authorized, the president has the right, granted by the Constitution to appoint or to nominate for appointment an officer the head of an agency or an office. And then with the Senate, we'll confirm that. And then that's where these agent heads come from. Right? Or officers. Right. I don't think we usually call them officers anymore. We call them cabinet members or we call them the heads of agencies, but, yeah. Second. And they're saying, well, we've already talked abo\", \"ut how we do appointments. We don't need to talk about more appointments. Now. We've already figured out in the last two papers. Second, as to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places, this chiefly concerns their duration and office, the provisions for their support, the precautions for their responsibility. According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior, which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions, and among the rest, to that of this state. Its propriety, having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection. Which disorders their imaginations and judgments. Damn. Wait, who wrote like 70? What did we read before? Who wrote federal paper 70? Hold on. This. Okay. Damn. Okay. This is written with significantly more elevated prose than some of the other ones I've read. Who? 77 o. Were they all. Okay, \", \"all right. Okay. The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the Judicial Magistracy. Magistracy is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government in a monarchy. It is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince in a republic. Less excellent. It is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws. So a lot of the federalist papers, they talk about, like, the british system, they talk about monarchies, and in here they're saying, well, a strong judiciary, it can protect a prince from anything, and it can evenect. It can protect a Congress from anything, right? It's no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body, that Congress could make laws and the judiciary can defend them. But it's also a rea\", \"lly good way to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws, right? Which is when you talk about. Whenever you talk about administration of laws or execution laws in Congress, you're always talking about the executive. You're talking about the president. Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive that in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution, because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can \", \"take no active resolution, whatever it may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment, and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm, even for the efficacy of its judgments. I feel like this is an argument against judicial review, but I guess we'll get there. So here they're saying that, like, well, we shouldn't be threatened by judges in terms of how they can attack us, because the judiciary basically can only hold the executive to account and prevent the legislature from doing wacky shit. They can't. The judges are neither executors of power. Nor are they writers of legislation for power. Right. The simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves, incontestably that the judiciary is, beyond comparison, the weakest of the three departments of power. That can never attack with success either of the other two. And that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves t\", 'hat though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice. The general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter. I mean, so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive. For I agree that there is no liberty. If the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. And it proves in the last place that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone. But that would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments, saying that. So a judiciary that stands on its own. Should never threaten liberty. But a judiciary aligned with one of the the other departments. Would be a grave threat. Which makes sense, remember, because up here, he said that a judiciary could protect a corrupt prince. And it could protect a corrupt legislature. Right? Makes sense. That is, all the effects of such an union. Must ensue from a dependence of the former', ' on the latter. Notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation that as from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered OEdd. Or influenced by its coordinate branches. And that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution. And in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security. So, arguing that because these other two branches are so politically beholden. That the judiciary should stand as lifetime appointments. Essentially because it insulates them from the political pressures of Congress or the executive right. The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution, I understand, one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority. Such, for instance, as that it shall ', \"pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws and the like. Ex post facto law, I believe, refers to the idea that you pass a law criminalizing prior behavior. That now you can be held criminally liable for it'a bill of attain. Or something that circumvents your due. Hold on. Let me check this real quick. A bill of attainder is a law that punishes a person or group without a judicial trial. Okay, okay. And the like. So this is saying that a limited constitution is one that even the legislature is not allowed to pass, a law that would arrest people with no due process or pass laws that would criminalize past behavior, that you would now be held criminally liable for. Right. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing. Okay, th\", \"is is your strong argument for judicial review, then? Okay. Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void because contrary to the Constitution has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority from it is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the american constitutions, a brief discussion. The ground on which it rests cannot be accept, cannot be unacceptable. So some people argue that, oh, well, fine, if the judiciary can just nullify anything from the legislature, it must be superior to the legislature. And Hamilton says, just because you can say that an act coming from them is void doesn't mean that you have more power than the people passing the act. So that's not true. And you'll go on to argue this, t\", \"here are no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a delegated authority contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void. Okay, so he's saying one of the most essential ideas of governance is that if you delegate something to an authority, whatever is doing the delegation must be supporting the delegated power, right? If you delegate it, you can't. Something that's contrary to the tenor of the commission would be void. You can't have the constitution granting something to the legislature, and then the legislature defies the constitution, then the defiance would make whatever that act isoid avoid act essentially right. No legislative act, therefore contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principle, that the servant is above his master, that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves, that men acting by virtue of powers may do not o\", \"nly what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid. Just reinforcing that the louder with Crowder CEO wants to talk o throw me in anytime you want, chief smiley face case. If it be said theres s not too much more of this. Ok. If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers and. And that the construction that they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered that this cannot be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. Whenever you see the word construction, I believe that construction refers to the idea of deciding whether or not a particular thing is in concordance with the thing that authorizes it, with the law that authorizes it. So when you talk about statutory construction, you're talking about a judiciary system reviewing a thing or somebody reviewing a thing saying, does this comport with the law? I think that's statutory \", \"construction. So Congress passes a law, and somebody wants to say, does this comport with the Constitution? Is this actually like a legal law? Can you really pass? That would be a statutory construction. So this is saying you can't allow the body passing laws to do statutory construction on their own. That would be ridiculous, because then they could pass whatever they want and decide whatever they pass is legal. They'd have no check on their power there. It is not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to sub substitute their will to that of the constituents. It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact, and must be regarded by the judg\", \"es as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred. Or in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people, to the intention of their agents. So basically saying that, like, if there's a disagreement between what a judge would say, Congress says versus what the Constitution says, the Constitution is not federal law. Okay, I kind of argued with this. I don't know what a law professor would say. This is a feeling that I have. I could be wrong. If there's a federal or if there's a constitutional law wants to disagree, feel free to let me know. But, like, I don't think it'you, shouldn't conceive of the constitution as federal law. It's not. Federal law is passed by the legislatu\", \"re, and they get their mandate, their power from the constitution. Okay, so re, so it's not like federal statutes and laws and like the Constitution and the amendments are all the same. They're not. It is. The Constitution is the engine that powers things like the legislative body, which then passes federal laws. And if you have an irreconcilability between a federal law and the Constitution, the Constitution is always preferred, because you're not comparing one law to another. You're comparing the supreme law or the Constitution to a statute or law passed by the Congress which gets its power or authority from the Constitution. Right? And they're saying that obviously it's the judiciary that makes these decisions. Nor does this conclusion, by any means, suppose the superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both, and that where the will of the legislature declared in its statutes stands in opposition to that of the\", ' people declared in the constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than by the former. So because the constitution represents the will of the people, anytime the constitution and the legislature disagree, or the will of the legislature disagrees, judges ought to be here to preserve adherence to the constitution, not to the legislature. Right. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by those which are not fundamental. Constitutional law versus statutes passed by Congress this exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two contradictory laws is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation, so far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconci', \"led to each other. Reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done. Where this is impractical, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, an exclusion of the other. So talking about, well, what happens when you pass two laws and they seem to be in discord with each other't? Something is contradictory. One law says one thing, another law says another thing. They stand a direct opposition. Right. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the last, in order of time, shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision but adopted by themselves as consonant to truth and propriety for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law, they thought it reasonable that between the interfering acts of an equal authority, that that which was the last \", \"indication of its will should have the preference. So it's saying, well, one way that courts resolve this, let's say there's a law that says cars should be legal. Another law says car shouldn't be legal. Well, what was the last law of the legislature passed? It's the one that says cars shouldn't be legal. So even if they didn't include a clause saying, we're gonna repbeal the last law, you would probably prefer the last one because it seems to be representing the will of the legislature. Right? But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority. Oh, but keep in mind here, he's talking about only when you're talking about an equal authority, meaning one law passed by the legislature compared to another law passed by the legislature. Right. But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power. Right. The constitution and the legislature is an original. The constitution, derivative power. The legislat\", 'ure that derives its power from the constitution, the nature and reason of the thing, indicate the converse of that rule as property to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority, and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former. So obviously saying that a court should rule in concordance with the superior governing authority, even if an inferior one disagrees at a later point in time. It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes, or it might as well happen in every adjudication. Upon any single statute, the courts must declare the sense of the law. And if they should be di', \"sposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove anything, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body. So they're saying that the judiciary exists only for statutory construction, not to impose their will, not to write legislation. Right? This is when people call legislating from the bench. This is kind of what they're talking about, not the judges. Aren't there to write legislation. They're only there to impose their judgment, deciding if a thing is that we concordance with the law or not. Otherwise, if judges could write their own legislation, then they're not distinct at all from the legislative body itself. Right. This is one of the chief arguments kind of against the idea of Roe v. Wade, the construction of, like, the right to privacy. From your peumb number of rights you're trying to figure out, they're saying that, oh, well, hold\", ' on. It feels like judges are writing legislation. Right? It. Yeah. If then the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty. The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals. From the effects of those ill humors which the arts of designing men or the influence of particular conjectures, sometimes conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the meantime to occasion dangerous innovations in the government and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. So you ne', \"ed independence, because if you don't have independence, sometimes you get individuals that wantna do wacky and crazy things, things especially because of political influence and the desire to win reelection and to run again. So you want them to be shielded from this. So he's, this federalist paper is making arguments for the lifetime appointments basically as an essential safeguard to the independence of the judiciary. Right, though I trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness. Yet it is not to be inferred from this principle that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents incompatible with the provisions in the existing constitution, would on that account be ju\", \"stifiable in a violation of those provisions, or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. That's a strong statement, basically saying that we trust people to do the right thing. However, if at some moment in time they decide to rise up and fight against the constitution. The legislature should not have the ability to do that. The judiciary will hold firm and do their constitutional interpretations as such. And if the legislature really wants to fight the constitution, they need to change the constitution. They can't put themselves above it. They have to change it. Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, and always about associ here annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves, collectively as well as individually. The presumptive form being the constitutional author basically set the legislative declaration se\", \"t out in the constitution right as well as individually, and no presumption or even knowledge of their sentiments can warrant their representatives in a departure from it. Prior to such an act. You cannot violate the constitution without changing the constitution right. But it is easy to see that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community. So if there was a moment in time where people were being wacky and crazy, and your judges had to, like, run for reelection, it's easy to see that a jud it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude. It would require an uncommon like will for a judge to resist that political inclination. Right? It would be very difficult. But it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution, only that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occa\", 'sional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistra. Magistrac is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body and passing them who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled by the very motives of the injustice they mediate to qualify their attempts. I think this is basically arguing it, saying that just by virtue of having an independent judiciary, you ensure better laws from the legislature, because they know that the judiciary is going to be checking you right. The firmness of the Maj. Magistracy, the firmness and the separation of th', 'e courts, serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those right. It operates as a check upon the legislative body and pass them right. That the legislature will take into account. We try to do this course will fuck us. So that. Right. That helps. Right. Yeah. This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments than. But few may be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more states than one. And though they may have been, they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed. They must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested considerate men of every description ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts, as no man can be sure that he may not be tomorrow the victim of a spirit of injustice by which he may be a gainer today. And basically saying that, like, you should champion whe', \"n the court shut down stuff. Because, hey, it might be you getting fuck tomorrow. Right? And every man must now feel that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to SAP the foundations of public and private confidence and introduce in it stead universal distrust and distress. You can't let people break laws like the legislature break laws because it would. It would. It would fuck with everybody. Nobody would trust the system. Right? That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the constitution and of individuals which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice. Can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however regulated or by whomsoever made, would in some way or other be fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaceancece to the branch which possessed it. If to bot\", \"h, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either. If to the people or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the constitution and the laws. So basically saying that, like, if the justices have to rely on the president's approval, then they're going toa always support the president. And if they've got to rely on the legislature's approval, they're always going to support the legislature. There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked with great propriety that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government to avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and pr\", \"ecedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them. And it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unoid, unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. It sounds like this is a lawyer. I say anything wrong, feel free to corackct me. Sounds like this is basically outlining a concept called, in modern law, stare decisis. And Gorsuch talks about this when he wrote the opinion in the Chevron case. That, that there's a collective wisdom that can be spoken about, passed down from decision to decision to decision. That's why legal precedent exists. That's why the jurisprudence of the court exists and depends upon necessarily the decisions before them. Because there is a, every judge before them has seen these decisions, made these decisions, and\", \" affirm these decisions, and there's a wisdom passed down that you should pay attention to. It's important, right? Yeah. It's those decisions, as they pass down, unavoidably, swell to a very considerable bulk and must demand long and labor study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. You probably have to study a long time, go to law school, do everything else to understand, like, you know, all the law that comes before you. Right? Hence it is that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature. Number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge. Not many people are going toa be able to study enough to do this. Basically, these considerations apprise us that the government can have no great option between fit character and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally \", \"discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, which would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able and less well qualified to conduct it with unity, utility and dignity. That if you've got, like, if the terms are temporary, like, people just aren't gonna quit their jobs to be Supreme Court justices, and they'gona there's gonna be all this political shit, and it's just not. You're gonna deprive yourself of the best talent, basically, in the present circumstances of this country and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come. The disadvantages on the score would be greater than they may at first sight appear. But it must be confessed that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of this subject. You have a lot to lose by having not lifetime appointments, basically. And that as time goes on, you're really going to notice that upon the whole, th\", \"ere could be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices. In point of duration. I think this means instead of duration, in point of right. Or maybe when you talk about the duration, it's only because you have good behavior, not because you've got some appointed time, basically. And that so far from being blameable on this account, their plan would have been inexcusably defective if it had wanted this important feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution. Okay, there you go. So I made the statement I'd read somewhere before that in Marbury B. V. Madison, when the court grants itself the ability for judicial review, it seems like that decision wasn't something that the framers originally maybe originally envisioned. They had only envisioned the court to basically have the fi\", \"nal say in court cases. And then Peisco said, well, actually, in the federalist papers, you know, the founding fathers did give arguments that seemed to point towards judicial review. And then someone who chats said, oh, federalist number 78. This's a federal 78. We read it. This makes. These are undeniably incredibly strong arguments for the concept of judicial review. I mean, blanket, right. The idea that you can say no to the legislature because it doesn't comport with the superior authority, the constitution.\\n\\nC: Right.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, there you go.

It argues that the provision for judges to hold their offices during good behavior is an essential safeguard for the impartial administration of the laws.', \"This segment continues the discussion on the importance of judicial independence, stating that it serves as an excellent barrier against the despotism of the prince in a monarchy and the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body in a republic. It emphasizes the judiciary's role in securing a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.\", \"This segment discusses the relative powers of the three branches of government, arguing that the judiciary is the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution because it lacks the power of the sword and the purse held by the executive and legislative branches, respectively. It suggests that the judiciary's role is to hold the other branches accountable.\", 'This segment continues the discussion on the relative weakness of the judiciary compared to the other branches of government, stating that the judiciary has no influence over the sword or the purse and must ultimately depend on the executive arm for the efficacy of its judgments. It argues that the judiciary is the weakest of the three departments of power.', \"This segment argues that the judiciary, when truly distinct from the legislative and executive powers, poses no threat to the general liberty of the people. However, it warns that a judiciary aligned with either of the other two departments would be a grave threat to liberty. It emphasizes the importance of the judiciary's independence.\", \"This segment continues the discussion on the importance of judicial independence, stating that the judiciary's natural feebleness means it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered or influenced by the other branches. It argues that permanency in office is an indispensable ingredient in the judiciary's constitution and a key to its independence.\", 'This segment discusses the concept of a \"limited constitution,\" which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority, such as prohibitions on bills of attainder and ex post facto laws. It argues that the preservation of such limitations can only be achieved through the medium of the courts of justice, which must have the duty to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.', 'This segment addresses the argument that the doctrine of judicial review, which allows the courts to declare legislative acts void, implies a superiority of the judiciary over the legislative power. It refutes this argument, stating that just because the courts can declare an act void does not mean they are superior to the legislative body that passed the act.', 'This segment reinforces the principle that any act of a delegated authority that is contrary to the terms of the commission under which it is exercised is void. It argues that no legislative act contrary to the Constitution can be valid, as that would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than the principal, the servant is above the master, and the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves.', 'This segment addresses the argument that the legislative body is the constitutional judge of its own powers, and that its construction of those powers is conclusive upon the other departments. It rejects this idea, stating that it cannot be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution.', 'This segment continues the argument against the idea that the legislative body can be the sole judge of the constitutionality of its own actions. It states that it is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.', 'This segment argues that the interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts, and that a constitution must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It states that if there is an irreconcilable variance between the Constitution and a statute, the Constitution should be preferred, as it represents the will of the people over the intention of their agents (the legislature).', 'This segment further clarifies the relationship between the Constitution and federal laws, stating that the Constitution is not federal law itself, but rather the engine that powers the legislative body to pass federal laws. It argues that if there is a conflict between the Constitution and a federal statute, the Constitution should take precedence as the supreme law.', 'This segment reinforces the idea that the power of the people, as expressed in the Constitution, is superior to both the legislative and judicial powers. It states that where the will of the legislature, as declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to the will of the people as declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former.', \"This segment discusses the courts' role in resolving conflicts between two existing statutes. It states that the courts must try to reconcile the statutes through fair construction, but if that is not possible, they must give effect to one statute over the other, with the more recent statute generally taking precedence.\", 'This segment continues the discussion on resolving conflicts between statutes, stating that when the conflict is between a superior and subordinate authority, such as the Constitution and a federal statute, the prior act of the superior authority (the Constitution) should be preferred over the subsequent act of the inferior authority (the statute).', 'This segment reinforces the idea that the courts must adhere to the Constitution and disregard any statutes that contravene it. It argues that the courts are not substituting their own pleasure for the constitutional intentions of the legislature, but rather fulfilling their duty to interpret the law and determine its concordance with the Constitution.', 'This segment addresses the concern that the courts, in exercising their power of judicial review, may be \"legislating from the bench\" and substituting their own will for that of the legislative body. It argues that the courts\\' role is limited to interpreting the law and determining its constitutionality, not to writing legislation themselves.', 'This segment emphasizes the importance of the independence of the judiciary, stating that it is essential for the courts to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of \"ill humors\" and \"dangerous innovations\" that may arise from political influences and the desire for re-election. It argues that the permanent tenure of judicial offices is a key safeguard for this independence.', 'This segment acknowledges the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution, but argues that this does not mean the representatives of the people should disregard the existing constitution whenever a \"momentary inclination\" of the majority arises. It suggests that the courts have a duty to uphold the Constitution against such transient political pressures.', 'The text discusses the importance of judicial independence and the role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution, even in the face of legislative attempts to undermine it. It argues that the courts must have the fortitude to resist political pressures and remain faithful guardians of the Constitution.', 'The text continues the discussion on judicial independence, highlighting the challenges judges may face when the \"major voice of the community\" supports legislative actions that violate the Constitution. It emphasizes the importance of the judiciary\\'s firmness in mitigating the effects of unjust and partial laws.', 'The text explains how the independence of the judiciary serves as a check on the legislative branch, as the legislature is aware that the courts will scrutinize their actions. It argues that this dynamic helps produce better laws and protects individual rights.', \"The text further elaborates on the benefits of an independent judiciary, stating that it has already been felt in multiple states and has earned the esteem of virtuous and disinterested citizens. It suggests that everyone should champion the courts' role in upholding the Constitution.\", 'The text discusses the importance of judicial appointments being permanent rather than temporary, as periodic appointments would undermine the necessary independence of the courts. It argues that judges should not be beholden to the approval of the executive or legislative branches.', 'The text continues the discussion on judicial appointments, stating that even if the appointments were made by the people or their representatives, there would be a risk of the judges being too concerned with popularity rather than upholding the Constitution and the law.', 'The text explains the concept of legal precedent and the importance of judges being bound by strict rules and precedents, which requires extensive legal knowledge and study. It suggests that this necessity limits the pool of qualified individuals for judicial positions.', 'The text further elaborates on the challenges of finding individuals with the requisite legal knowledge and integrity to serve as judges, arguing that a temporary duration in office would discourage such qualified individuals from accepting judicial appointments.', 'The text concludes that the convention acted wisely in establishing good behavior as the tenure of judicial offices, as this feature is essential for good government. It suggests that the experience of Great Britain provides an illustrious example of the excellence of this institution.', 'The text discusses the concept of judicial review, noting that the arguments made in Federalist Paper No. 78 provide strong support for the idea that the framers envisioned the courts having the power to review the constitutionality of legislative actions.', 'The text continues the discussion on judicial review, acknowledging that the arguments made in Federalist Paper No. 78 are \"incredibly strong\" in supporting the concept of the courts having the authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative actions.'], href='https://youtu.be/OqVH_MTBQ6k?t=15')]"
