    "ex1=[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"\"\"Sorry, JK. Well, actually, I wanted to ask Steven a question. So, look, this is, I think Joe brings up a really good point from here, from everything I've seen, for us to get back to normal, for us to have a shot of winning the electoral college, Biden has to change things enough to get, I think, 13 points more up in the polls. Now, some of that is in swing states like Michigan. What is the actual plan? Or what pathway do you see to Biden kind of changing this narrative? Because, like, what I saw in that interview last night was, frankly, just a very stubborn old man who thinks everything is fine. And we've seen this playbook before with Diane Feinstein, and we saw it with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, people that were just kind of a little tuned out to reality. So what is the concrete? What do you think happens with Biden? For him to have a shift to get confidence from the american public and turn this around? I really need an answer to that.\"\"\"},\n",
    "{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"\"I don't think that populism is popular right now with the Democratic Party, but I think that populist messaging is important. Whoever does the debate coaching for Biden or speech coaching, the idea that he needs to be on stage rattling off 50 million figures like he's a nervous, like, high school debate speed person or whatever, that absolutely never needs to happen. Biden needs to find a few good quotes, a few good slogans, and just hammer them over and over and over again. I think that that gives them the best presence on stage rather than if you're asked about the economy. Okay, how do you think economy did out to your country? Like, instead of 45% of Americans had this in 72%, it should just literally be, my economy did better than Trump, who cheated on his wife with a porn star, or my economy, it's doing better than the guy who's got 34 felons. Right? It just, just be hammering stuff like that. Over and over and over again because it's quippy. It works. People like it. Nobody cares about the numbers on either side at this point. There's no reason to have this huge fact based material analysis of everything on nobody cares. Like most people's. Like, even people's understandingings of how the economy doing sometimes goes back to just the news that they consume and the media that they're watching. And to try to play by this different rule set where Biden is supposed to quote like 52 different figures while Donald Trump thinks that invisible planes are actually invisible. And there's literally no standard for his speaking or his mental capacity is insane in my opinion. That's what at least for messaging, that's focus on that.\"\"\"}]\n"
