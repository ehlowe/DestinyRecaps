        Destiny''s takes and sentiment:


        1. Streaming challenges: Destiny expresses frustration with streaming as a
        job, calling it "soul-draining" and mentioning issues like DMCA strikes for
        music.


        2. Video game design: He seems impressed by a game design element explained
        to him, calling it "fucking amazing game design."


        3. Drama indifference: Destiny expresses a lack of interest in drama involving
        younger streamers/influencers, saying he''s "trying so hard to care" but can''t.


        4. Abortion and mental health: He acknowledges the importance of discussing
        these topics and normalizing them, while also distinguishing between general
        discussions and leaking specific personal information.


        5. Fashion: Destiny is hesitant to comment on women''s fashion, fearing it
        might be perceived as hateful. He rates some outfits but avoids strong criticism.


        6. Candace Owens: Destiny agrees with criticism of Owens, describing her as
        a "coward and an idiot" who dodges questions and makes claims without evidence.


        7. Video production: Destiny speculates about the production techniques used
        in a video, discussing potential overdubbing, green screen usage, and added
        background noise.

        a stream-of-consciousness manner. His tone ranges from frustrated to analytical
        to humorous, depending on the subject. He shows particular interest in technical
        aspects of content creation and seems to enjoy dissecting media and performances
        critically.'

      transcript: 'Destiny: Sorry, I''m busy watching 30 minutes of season six cases
        Housemd uploaded three months ago. Mind me, it''s the sociopath episode. Not
        at all. Well, you should be.


        B: You let him know what I told you. I will not only have your life.


        Destiny: Show emotions. Okay, never mind. I''ll turn it off. Fuck. I feel
        when you have to go to work. This is why streaming is the most soul draining
        job. You guys think that your work is hard. When was the last time you got
        DMC aide for listening to music at work? Even one of you. Even one of you?
        It''s never happened. Here. New nexus aminond here. I feel like I''m playing
        like baby''s first connect to a four walled room or something over and over
        again. It''s like some little fucking retarded baby putting a triangle in
        the circle hole going.


        C: And then a gargoyle is there when you want.


        Destiny: You take him. Yes, but what? But. But what if he expects that? How?
        We put another enemy so he sees it first. So the gard will come down. Go,
        you run back it. Very good. Wow. It''s really good, actually. That''s fucking
        amazing game design. That''s crazy. I never thought of it that way. What''s
        your name again? My name''s retard. Ret. Return.


        C: Ret return.


        Destiny: Fucking ret return. Oh my God. You''re wonderful. Your''re CEO and
        president it. Did this guy die a lot in playing or is he absolutely right?
        He made it for subs only so that he could benefit from. I''m trying so hard
        to care. I''m trying so hard to care about this drama. I love Dante. Yeah,
        he''s a funny dude, but this is so. These guys are like 22 okay, having breakups,
        I just. I can''t be fucked. I can''t be fucked. To care. Help me care. But
        not everyone views friendships as fake and surface level as you do. That they
        think that everything told to you privately would be aired out publicly. He
        was sitting there saying, oh, maybe I am a sociopath. And then later justifying
        his behaviors because he was mad at me, when the worst part is that the thing
        that he leaked was something that he was willing to leak over a situation
        over something that he was mad at her over. So whether he was mad at her or
        mad at me, he was willing to leak that situation, right. As I explained previously,
        he is a man that sits there and prides himself on a moral standing and a moral
        compass, when in reality he has absolutely none. He''s a man that sits there
        and prides himself on having character, when in reality he has absolutely
        none. And then after I''ve already gone through an abortion, I was super young.
        When happen. Oh, it''s episode twelve of everything on the Internet is the
        wrong volume. Yes. Yes. King uploader. Unee aka v tv or v what? V one. V nine.
        Thank you. Yes. Yes. At no volume. Is this going toa be the sequel edition
        where my volume plugin also doesn''t even change the volume of the Twitter
        page? Wait, I don''t even know if I have that plugin anymore. I hope I don''t.
        I hope I don''t have it. Sound fixer. Here we go. I hope it kills the volume
        on the page. Yes, I hope it kills the volume. I''ve already gone through an
        abortion. I was super young when that happened. Like talking about mental
        health, abortion stuff and stuff like that. I think these are topics that
        a lot of people don''t talk about because they''re not normalized, you know,
        like, we don''t normalize people going through stuff like that. And it''s
        especially like abortion in a super young age. Like, we don''t talk about
        what that does to a person, you know, because, like, this is like, there''s
        some time pasted since that happened, and I still suffer from it. I don''t.
        I wouldn''t say that I was forced into an abortion, but you have to understand,
        my family never thought I would get children because I was the type of person
        would always talk against it, because when I came up to, I was like, yo, I
        have to tell you something. Like, I''m pregnant. They were like, oh, okay,
        when are you getting in a bush? You know, they weren''t openly talking about
        it. They were not saying, yeah, like, oh, I''m sorry. Or like, how can I help
        your. What you want to do? It''s more of that. They already were thinking
        that I made a decision within myself. Now think I should have thought more
        about it? 100%. 100%. Do I sometimes regret doing it also? Yes. But if you
        oversee the emotional part and just think for a rational financial part, it
        was the right decision. Did the dad want the baby? No, no. The claim is that
        this clip is from before the other guy, the so emotional. No, it''s fine.
        It''s fine talking about it. Yeah, but I find it, I find it really important
        to talk about things like that because especially in this type of age, I find
        that girls that have like, mental problems or get abortions or whatever, I
        still looked upon down on, and I don''t think that''s fair to them. Okay,
        so Tarzan didn''t leak anything? No, there''s, there''s a huge difference
        between somebody saying they had an abortion at some point in time versus
        leaking a specific abortion at a specific timeline with a specific partner.
        Those are two very different things. So even if she. If this is assuming this
        clip is not a deep fake AI, I''m assuming that. But like, this conversation
        here doesn''t mean that Tarzan didn''t leak anything, that those are two totally
        different things. This is very unspecified and very not related to any particular
        person. Like, would you ban Tarzan if you were twitch? No. What would you
        get? We banned people for leaking shit. Now rate the fits. Okay, what do we
        got over here? We got Jreg, the hat, the shirt. Fuck. I can''t rate any casual,
        casual wear. Are the shorts a little short? I think this is okay. I get this
        guy. Okay. Out of ten, I''d say u who is this guy? I feel like I''ve seen
        this guy before. Seems fine. Seems cute. I think it''s okay, right? I like
        the socks on vau''s thing over here. These are nice. That''s the next big
        thing. Oh, Matt binder. Oh, have I argued with this too before? I a whole
        bunch of reading on fucking wool socks versus cotton socks and everybody gets
        like ultra fucking has very strong opinions on never, ever, ever, ever, ever
        buying cotton socks ever. I can''t comment on the girls thingus. I don''t
        know anything about girl fashion. Also, I feel like if you say anything about
        girl fashion, I feel like it can count as a hate comment. So I won''t say
        anything. Love the brave. No broad tr yeah, I was gonna say you probably do
        something different, but I feel like, I don''t know if I''m allowed to comment
        on that without. Without it being like, hateful. Her fit looks trash. I wouldn''t
        say that at all. I think something more could be done up there. Je Smith is
        having a combo game with Andrew Wilson again tonight. What do you think about
        Bowman? Dont know anything about him. I think pv was sporting him for a while.
        Right. I feel like I looked up something about this gu a long time ago, but
        there are people that have sat there and they havesh actually interacted with
        one another in person. Oh, Jesus. Oh, yeah. Because it was the canvassing
        forboent event. Wait it so I''m whale watching today. Oh, there''s one might
        say if it''s jump on a whale and ride our way out of it. O there''s another
        one.


        D: Just see how high it is in the background.


        Destiny: But it''s weird because it''s different Al like it''s blue on it.
        But then there''s like it almost it''s black. The dishonesty of Candace Owens
        and an idiot for 90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance on Piers
        Morgan and she did what she always does. She refused to answer a single question
        in a straightforward manner. She dodged responsibility for massive claims
        she''s made in the past without a scrap of it. And she''s too much of a coward
        to come out and say it. And to me, this is frustrating because if you genuinely
        believe that Jews ruled world, then just have the balls to say, hey, guys,
        jews rule the world. Don''t do this dancing around where you start to critique.
        Wait, what is happening? Why do I''m sorry. Iistically notice every. How does
        the audio on the SM seven be here sound worse than the audio on this dky little.
        What is this? Like one of those DJI hand mite. Candace Owens is a coward and
        an idiot. For 90 minutes last night I watched her appearance on Piers Morgan
        and she did. This is pretty clean. Pretty good. But then the SM seven b we''ve
        got the whole room echo. What''s oh, fuck. Twitter video. Is it an overdub?
        That''s actually one thing I was considering. I almost asked in the beginning,
        but you hear the. There''s a little bit of like cricket noise or whatever
        the fuck in the background. But maybe he added that in via a coward and an
        idiot. For 90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance. I was thinking
        too. It seems like it must be an overdub ca becausee he''s moving the micro
        room, but it doesn''t seem to affect the sound at all. Do you think he added
        in post the background noises think he did that because it looks like. It
        looks like it was dubbed. Right. Candace Owens is a coward and an idiot. For
        90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance on no way. Right. And she
        did what she always does. She refused to answer a single question in a straightforward
        manner. She dodged responsibility for massive claims. Like, this mic is being
        moved quite a bit and there''s no difference in sound quality. It''s gotta
        be an overdub. It has to be. It''s gotta be dubbed. And he''s got a. And he''s
        got a mask on, but, yeah, he''s got a mask on and it sounds so clean. No way.
        Right. Is made in the past without a scrap of evidence. You can hear the wind.
        Yeah, but I''m thinking he might have added the wind in post, like, he might
        have added the background noises, like, just did, like a passive recording.
        And then he adds it in after. And then when the conversation doesn''t go in
        a direction that she likes, sher, the background is not real. Oh, do you think
        he''s just sitting in front of like a green screen or some shit? And then
        when the conversation does, I feel like the lighting go in a direction that
        she likes.


        E: She.


        Destiny: It''s. I mean, if he did. He did the lighti'

      summary: 'Here''s a synopsis of the content and sentiment from the transcript:


        Main topics:

        1. Discussion of Candace Owens and her communication style

        2. Actor changes in movies (particularly Iron Man)

        3. Terrence Howard''s unconventional mathematical theories

        4. Brief exploration of physics concepts (absolute zero, ideal gas law)


        Content and sentiment:


        1. Candace Owens discussion:

        Destiny criticizes Candace Owens for valuing followers over truth. He suggests
        she avoids giving straightforward answers to simple questions, instead critiquing
        word meanings. Destiny believes Owens holds antisemitic views but is too cowardly
        to state them directly. He expresses frustration with her communication style
        and perceived lack of honesty.


        2. Actor changes in movies:

        Destiny discusses the change of actors for the character of James Rhodes in
        the Iron Man movies, from Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle. He expresses surprise
        at how noticeable the change was and how it wasn''t addressed in-universe.
        He also mentions a similar actor swap in Game of Thrones.


        3. Terrence Howard''s mathematical theories:

        Destiny plays a clip of Terrence Howard discussing his unconventional mathematical
        ideas, particularly about multiplication. Howard questions how 1x1 can equal
        1, arguing it doesn''t satisfy the concept of multiplication. Destiny seems
        skeptical and amused by Howard''s theories.


        4. Physics concepts:

        Prompted by Howard''s comments, Destiny briefly explores physics concepts
        like absolute zero and the ideal gas law. He demonstrates some knowledge of
        these topics but also admits uncertainty in some areas. He looks up information
        about absolute zero, enthalpy, and zero-point energy, showing curiosity about
        the subject.


        Throughout the transcript, Destiny''s tone is a mix of critical analysis,
        humor, and genuine curiosity. He''s quick to point out what he perceives as
        flaws in others'' arguments or presentations, but also shows interest in learning
        more about complex topics. The conversation jumps between subjects rapidly,
        reflecting a stream-of-consciousness style typical of live streaming content.'

      transcript: 'a direction that she likes, sher, the background is not real. Oh,
        do you think he''s just sitting in front of like a green screen or some shit?
        And then when the conversation does, I feel like the lighting go in a direction
        that she likes.


        E: She.


        Destiny: It''s. I mean, if he did. He did the lighting well and everything
        too, right? Because he''s got, like, this is like, warm. Seems like really
        warm lighting coming from what I imagine a sundown look under his arm. Virue
        signals, manufactured apathy. Now, any person with more than two brain cells
        can see what Candace Owens is. She''s a person who values followers more than
        the truth. And if what I just said bothers you or makes you angry, there''s
        probably a pretty good chance that you also think that Terrence Howard is
        some type of mathematical genius. And if that''s the case, you should know
        that. D that y.


        D: Honesty.


        Destiny: Okay. Right out of the gate, we get a pretty easy question. But instead
        of giving an easy answer, Candace Owens decides to start critiquing the meanings
        of words. Now, in my mind, there''s no real reason to do this, because when
        you hear a question like this, all that you need to do is simply say, yeah,
        I can see how Christ is king. How hot. How much gain do you think you have
        on this mic that he''s picking up so much room echo from an sm seven b. I
        feel like. I feel like the mic has to be so hot to get this. But then it would
        also sound blown the fuck out, right? Am I just wrong any what I''m talking
        about, it''s worse because he''re quitting this part live. It''s 100% d. Being
        in that whole debacle could have been construed as anti semitic. However,
        that''s not how I meant it, and then just stop talking. But she''s unwilling
        to do this because the core of the problem here in her mind isn''t the fact
        that there was a misunderstanding. The core of the problem here is that she
        genuinely believes that Jews rule the world and she''s too much of a coward
        to come out and say it. And to me this is frustrating, because if you genuinely
        believe that Jews ruled the world, then just have the balls to say, hey, God.
        Want them to mean, however, I am the arbiter of truth genocides on them by
        saying, oh, look, here''s some place against him. If you want to say something
        like you have insider information that the rest of Macron is who alleges,
        necessarily insult the power structures that literally hear him as much of
        it as she possibly can. And as that some right off the, okay, I like the shirt.
        Okay, what is the, um. Do I want to watch this or.


        C: Did you know how I figured it out? What''s one times 01:00.


        Destiny: A.M. i being racist? Or is this guy like a famous actor? Is that
        what he''s known for initially? He is, right. Oh, he was. Oh, the Iron man
        guy. True. Okay. I can''t believe they change you ever. Does it ever bother
        you when they change actors so deliberately and they just don''t say anything
        about it in universe? Why didn''t they just get a different guy? Why didn''t
        they just like make him a different character? It was seamless. And Iron man,
        they''re not even the same shade of black. What are you talking about, bro?
        We went from a caramel chocoly, you know, chocolate ice cream cone type black
        men to a straight, pure black, no shot. It wasn''t even close. These were
        completely different. Iron man one. I''m trying to think of the, what''s like
        a scene with him when he''s fighting the jets. Hold on.


        C: On the radar.


        Destiny: Got a minimal back in a global hawk in the area.


        C: So this thing just appeared out of nowhere.


        Destiny: We went from this to, let''s see, Iron man two. Party scene. Here''s
        where they lampshaded in Iron man two. Oh my God. Stop. 60 FPS upscaling videos.
        It doesn''t look good. It doesn''t look better. It''s not an improvement.
        Stop doing this. It''s stupid. Please stop doing this. God, it is so trash.
        Garbage. Stop. If you have to do anything with a video ever that involves
        the word interpolation. Don''t do it if the frame''s not there. The frame''not?
        There. Please, God, stop. Sorry. Okay, but we have to suffer through it anyway.
        Doesn''t he. Doesn''t he come in initially with the. Oh, there he is. No,
        he''s actually, you know what? ##uck maybe he''s not as black as I remember
        him. Don Sheetle. No, he''s Iron man. No, he''s significantly blacker. Okay.
        But in this, it''s a dark scene. You can''t tell. Okay? It''s different here.
        Don''t take this. Don''t take my word for it. Here, listen, we''re aborting
        this. We''re boarding this line of dialogue. Hey, buddy, you expect to see
        you here. Look, it''s me. I''m here. Deal with it. Let''s move on. I just.
        I drop it. All right, I''ll drop it. I have before me a complete report on
        the Iron man. Wait, this is where they lampshade it. Wait, how is that a reference
        to. That''s a reference to them changing the actors. How? Because he said,
        I didn''t expect to see you here or. You''re right. Here''s them together.
        Don''t get gas lit. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I was right. Thank you. App.
        Pure cinema. I don''t know how it cinema, but there was this one and then
        there was the Game of Thrones swap, where the most egregious, especially because
        in Game of Thrones are so many characters, I didn''t even know for, like,
        ten episodes that these were supposed to be the same person. I was like, oh,
        okay, caus.


        C: You know how I figured it out? What''s one times one?


        Destiny: One times one is one. I''m talking about for Dario. People who bring
        up the mountain are dumb. He turn it into zombie. Who cares?


        C: To multiply means to do what? To make more.


        Destiny: Right?


        C: Yes. Increase the number.


        Destiny: Yes.


        C: Multiply?


        Destiny: Yes.


        C: How can one times one equaling one be part of the multiplication table?
        It fails to satisfy the term multiply. It doesn''t multiply, does it? What''s
        an action? Times in action.


        Destiny: You got some wee?


        C: No, no, I''m.


        Destiny: Wait, this isn''t the one that all the dipshits in my chat were screaming
        at me to go to review a few weeks ago. Was it? Because this is seven months
        old? No. Reason.


        C: Reason.


        Destiny: Reason.


        C: I want you to reason. What''s an action times an action. A reaction, right?
        Have you ever seen an action times in actual a reaction? Have you no, because
        every. Because equanimity is the currency of the universe. There''s always
        an action timesion having a reaction. So how can one times one equal one?
        How can.


        Destiny: Terrence Howard is like a legitimate genius, like he said. Is it
        this? I think it''s this one. The Jo Rogan experience.


        C: Everything, all motion is expressed in waves. All waves are expressed in
        curves. It always makes spirals.


        Destiny: So because of the concept of gravity, and because of the concept
        of this event horizon, this super point of gravity, this infinite point that
        light can''t even escape, that this exists because of the.


        C: Of their gravity and their math. Remember, they have a thing called zero.
        They go from one to zero to negative one. There is no zero to even think zero.


        Destiny: So do you think that zero is a concept that came along with currency?


        C: It should be attached to currency in that regard? Because in physics, there
        is. It''s either. Nothing remains still. There''s nothing still in the universe.
        There''s nothing that doesn''t have motion, because everything is connected.
        So if one thing is ste. Everything that''s connected to it has to be stillel.
        There can never be one thing still. So as electricity tries to get to its
        balanced state, right? When it gets there, magnetism takes over and it pushes
        over. So there''s this pendulum.


        Destiny: Oh, God, this is going to be some schizo shit. I think what he''s
        saying here is technically kind of true, that nothing in the universe is still.
        Although I don''t know at what level he''s talking about, because technically,
        if there were absolutely no movements subatomically or anything, you would
        have, like, absolute zero, which implies a complete and total lack of movement,
        like, everywhere. Right? Although I don''t know if that actually is only classically
        in physics or if that manifests in quantum mechanics as well. Let''s just
        read, you know, what general and special relativity came out the day. You
        know, we might just do physics for like, 3 hours here. Okay, I''m curious.
        Fuck it. Let''s look. Let''s read absolute zero. Okay? I don''t know how much
        where this, but absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature
        scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach
        their minimum value, taken as zero kelvin. Thermodynamic temperature is a
        quantity defined in thermodynamics as distinct from kinetic theory or statistical
        mechanics. Enthalpy and thermodynamics. Enthalpy is the sum of a thermodynamic
        system''s internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It is
        a state function used in many measurements in chemical, biological, and physical
        systems. At a constant external pressure, which ismediently provided by the
        large what? Ambient atmosphere. Okay. And an ideal gas is a theoretical gas
        composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to inter
        particle interactions. I don''t. I feel like in chemistry, I learned something
        called the ideal gas law. What was that about? I don''t remember, though.
        Ideal gas law. What was that for? Was that for calculating something? I don''t
        remember what it was for, but okay. The fundamental particles of nature have
        minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy
        induced particle motion. What does. Zero point energy is the lowest possible
        energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics,
        quantum systems constantly fluctuate, and their lowest energy state is described
        by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore, even at absolute zero,
        atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion. Oh, okay. So I wasn''t
        sure if it was. If the absolute zero thing was just classical and not related,
        or it doesn''t go that deep. So I guess. So, in a classic'

      summary: 'Here''s a synopsis of the content and sentiment from the transcript:


        Main topics:

        1. Discussion of quantum mechanics and absolute zero

        2. Brief tangent on cell biology and human body composition

        3. Story about evacuating a young journalist and her family from Gaza


        Detailed breakdown:


        1. Quantum mechanics and absolute zero:

        Destiny reads and discusses information about quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg
        uncertainty principle, and the concept of absolute zero. He explores ideas
        like zero-point energy, quantum field theory, and the limitations of the ideal
        gas law. Destiny seems curious but somewhat overwhelmed by the complexity
        of the topics, admitting there are many concepts he doesn''t understand. He
        shows interest in learning about different temperature scales and the quantum
        mechanical description of matter at absolute zero.


        Sentiment: Curious, slightly overwhelmed, eager to learn


        2. Cell biology and human body composition:

        The conversation briefly shifts to discussing the composition of human cells
        and the body''s water content. Destiny asks questions about what it means
        when people say humans are made up of a certain percentage of water. He learns
        about cytoplasm and the structure of eukaryotic cells.


        Sentiment: Inquisitive, seeking clarification


        3. Evacuating a journalist from Gaza:

        A guest (referred to as "E") shares a story about helping evacuate a young
        journalist named La Jamus and her family from Gaza. They discuss the challenges
        of the evacuation, including raising $100,000 and dealing with family separation.
        The story takes an emotional turn when they mention the family''s desire to
        return to Gaza, despite the dangers.


        Sentiment: Empathetic, concerned, slightly frustrated


        Throughout the transcript, Destiny''s tone shifts between intellectual curiosity
        (when discussing scientific topics) and emotional engagement (when hearing
        about the Gaza evacuation). He seems to prefer the less controversial scientific
        discussions, expressing discomfort with potentially triggering political content.


        The conversation is somewhat disjointed, jumping between complex scientific
        concepts and personal anecdotes. Destiny appears to be multitasking or preparing
        for another event, which adds to the scattered nature of the discussion.


        Overall, the transcript showcases Destiny''s wide-ranging interests and his
        ability to engage with both abstract scientific concepts and real-world humanitarian
        issues, while also revealing his preference for less emotionally charged topics.'

      transcript: 'te is described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore,
        even at absolute zero, atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion.
        Oh, okay. So I wasn''t sure if it was. If the absolute zero thing was just
        classical and not related, or it doesn''t go that deep. So I guess. So, in
        a classical, mechanically understood system, even at absolute zero, for quantum
        mechanics, you would say that atom and molecules still retain some kind of
        vibrational motion, I guess. But maybe the overall sum of the energy comes
        out to be zero. In a classical system or something apart from atoms and molecules,
        the empty space of the vacuum also has these properties. According to quantum
        field theory, the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles, but
        continuous fluctuating fields, matter fields, whose quanta and firrmions,
        that is, leptons and quarks and force fields whose quanta are boinss. Bo right.
        Photons and gluons. Jesus. All these fieldills have zero point energy. These
        fluctuating zero point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an ether
        in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However,
        thisther ether cannot be thought of as a physical medium if it is to be Lorentz
        invariant, such that there is no contradiction with Einstein''s theory of
        special relativity. There might be ten different things in this one paragraph
        that I do not understand. Holy shit, how bored am I today? I won''t click
        all of these. I''ll spare you. The theoretical temperature is determined by
        extrapolating the ideal gas law, which is the equation of state of a hypothetical
        ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under
        many conditions, although it has several limitations. By international agreement,
        absolute zero is taken as -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, which equals
        -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. The corresponding Kelvin and Rakin
        temperature scales set their zero point at absolute zero by definition. I''ve
        never heard of rankine. I''ve never heard of this scale of my life. It is
        commonly thought of as the lowest possible temperature or lowest temperature
        possible. But it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real
        substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled, as they approach
        the change of state to liquid and then to solid. And the sum of the enthalpy
        of vaporization gas to liquid, and enthalpy of fusion, liquid to solid, exceeds
        the ideal gases change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum mechanical
        description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state. The point of
        lowest internal energy. Laws of thermodynamics indicate that Ep zero cannot
        be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the
        substances being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically.
        Even a system at absolute zero, if it could somehow be achieved, would still
        possess quantum mechanical zero point energy, the energy of its ground state.
        At absolute zero, the kinetic energy of the ground state, cannot be removed.
        Scientists and technologists, that''s a word, routinely achieve temperatures
        close to absol zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as Bose Einstein
        condensate superconductivity and superfluidity. Okay, based. Okay, back to
        this guy, right?


        C: When it gets there, magnetism takes over, and it pushes over. So there''s
        this pendulum, and as soon as it gets to this state, it bounces off that other
        noble gas, and it makes its way all the way back over here, and it''s about
        to have equanimity, and then it getsics over. It pushes over. So there''s
        this pendulum, and as soon as it gets to this, it bounces off that other noble
        gas, and it makes its way all the way back over here, and it''s about to have
        equanimity, and then it gets pulled back into the other direction, and that''s
        the breathing in and breathing out and the pendulum effect that we''ve all
        observed, the natural phenomena in the universe, and that''s.


        Destiny: A part of everything.


        C: Everything behaves that way. Every one of our cells comes down to. Our
        cells are made up of water, mostly water, 80%, 90% water. Somewhere, water
        is hydrogen. Hydrogen has twelve vortices that''s behaving with it. Twelve.


        Destiny: Wait. I''m actually curious. I''ve never actually questioned that
        before. When people say that humans are made up of, like, 80% 70% water. What
        does that actually mean? It''s not actually, like, h two o, is it? Are they
        talking about, like, the, like, complicated, like, poly carbon chains that
        have h two o in it? Or do they mean, like, just, like, straight out water?
        What does it mean, humans percentage water. When they say that the human body
        is made of water, do they mean actual h two o k water? Or does liid. In general,
        they mean actual water? Think of soda. It''s predinantly water, right? However,
        it''s got plenty of stuff dissolved in it. Cells are, and this is simplifying
        a lot, basically, water balloons filled with soda. You''ve got a membrane
        which keeps all of the soda in. The soda''mostly, water with the proteins
        and stuff your body needs dissolved into it. Oh, so, like, the inside of a
        cell, like, the cytoplasm of a cell, is mainly just water with other stuff
        floating in it. In cell biology, the cytoplasm describes all material within
        a eukaryotic cell enclosed by the cell membrane. What does this just mean,
        that has a membrane? Is that the difference? Eukaryes constitute the domain
        of ur organisms who cells have a membrane bound nucleus. Oh, okay. So their
        DNA doesn''t just float like a crazy guy all around the cell, close by. The
        cell membrane exc. The cell nucleus. The material inside the nucleus and contained
        within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The main components
        of the cytoplasm are the cytosol, a gel like substance. The organelles. The
        Ce sell internal substructures in various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm
        is about 80% water and is usually colorless. Okay, so that''s like. And that
        would be the majority of our bodydies. So when researching into things, do
        you begin to have a lot of respect for these people who have conceptualized
        these phenomenon? It''one thing to read, study, and learn these concepts,
        but at one point, they never even existed. Yeah, that''s kind of cute. Like
        the germ theory of cells. Wait, o am I doing this today? M doing a politics
        discord server thing today. It''s okay. Oh, God. All right, that''s okay.
        We''ll do this. Somebody tells wasos what I''m, like, sweating over here.
        I don''t know if you''re giving me, like. No, no. Yeah, no, I didn''t know
        what you were talking about. Okay, well, you told me that while we were driving,
        and it was the coolest thing that I''ve ever heard. So if you could please
        share it.


        E: I don''t want to give a shitty second hand verion of it.


        Destiny: Of course. No, you''re fine. So there''s a girl, she''s dubbed the
        youngest journalist in Gaza. Well, she was. Her name is La Jamus. You talked
        to her before. Yeah, I remember. It was a horrible fucking conversation. It
        was''about Israel Palestine. It was about something else. She''s just a random,
        like, copy pasted, woke dip shit, basically.


        E: And she basically just kind of took.


        Destiny: A camera and a microphone. She started speaking into it and she did
        journalism, and it was really cool. And her father reached out to my content
        creator friend and was like, we need to get out of Gaza. Because they were
        stuck in Gaza. They had no way out. And my friend and I, we fundraised about
        $100,000 for them and we evacuated her, her three siblings, her grandmother,
        her father and her mom. And it was an insane four months. We were, like, going
        back and forth. There were. Mom, $100,000. Wait, how much do you pay the illegal
        egyptian smugglers or whatever to smuggle people out of the Gaza Strip? $100,000.
        That''s where we thought it couldn''t happen. There was a moment where the
        father had to stay back in Gaza and the family, we had to smuggle the family
        through before we could smuggle the father. And that was also, like, a huge
        contention point within the family. Like, we had to separate them for a couple
        of weeks. It was a lot. And so recently I flew out to Qatar. Well, Qatar was
        my, like, my midpoint, but I flew out to Cairo to go meet them for the first
        time. And we were initially very excited to see them. But once we got there,
        we realized that it was actually, like, not a very happy moment because they
        basically had gotten a place to stay at. And the father told us, and he was
        like, yeah, I''m not planning to stay here long because we''re gonna go back
        to Gaza. And none of us have the heart to tell them, like, you''re not go
        back. You know what I mean? So was it was. What do you mean? Wait, no, I don''t
        know what that means. Wait, what the fuck is she talking about? First of all,
        when were these people smuggled out? Was it during the war or was it before?
        What? It was tough. Like, you could see the pain. Like, they had very visibly,
        like, physically lost weight. It was tough, but I''m happy we were able to
        get them out.


        C: Jesus.


        E: That''s genuinely insane, what the father said.


        Destiny: It reminds me, I saw these photos once of them were like, why would
        a white western random retarded dipshader has no fucking idea about anything.
        Like try toure leure. Anybody coming out of Gaza or anybody in any part of
        this region about whether or not they can u don''don''t link me this. I don''t
        want to read this. I don''t need be, I don''t need to get the trigger today,
        okay, stop. We were doing physics, okay? Physics less controversial. Back '

        Housemd uploaded three months ago. Mind me, it''s the sociopath episode. Not
        at all. Well, you should be.


        B: You let him know what I told you. I will not only have your life.


        Destiny: Show emotions. Okay, never mind. I''ll turn it off. Fuck. I feel
        when you have to go to work. This is why streaming is the most soul draining
        job. You guys think that your work is hard. When was the last time you got
        DMC aide for listening to music at work? Even one of you. Even one of you?
        It''s never happened. Here. New nexus aminond here. I feel like I''m playing
        like baby''s first connect to a four walled room or something over and over
        again. It''s like some little fucking retarded baby putting a triangle in
        the circle hole going.


        C: And then a gargoyle is there when you want.


        Destiny: You take him. Yes, but what? But. But what if he expects that? How?
        We put another enemy so he sees it first. So the gard will come down. Go,
        you run back it. Very good. Wow. It''s really good, actually. That''s fucking
        amazing game design. That''s crazy. I never thought of it that way. What''s
        your name again? My name''s retard. Ret. Return.


        C: Ret return.


        Destiny: Fucking ret return. Oh my God. You''re wonderful. Your''re CEO and
        president it. Did this guy die a lot in playing or is he absolutely right?
        He made it for subs only so that he could benefit from. I''m trying so hard
        to care. I''m trying so hard to care about this drama. I love Dante. Yeah,
        he''s a funny dude, but this is so. These guys are like 22 okay, having breakups,
        I just. I can''t be fucked. I can''t be fucked. To care. Help me care. But
        not everyone views friendships as fake and surface level as you do. That they
        think that everything told to you privately would be aired out publicly. He
        was sitting there saying, oh, maybe I am a sociopath. And then later justifying
        his behaviors because he was mad at me, when the worst part is that the thing
        that he leaked was something that he was willing to leak over a situation
        over something that he was mad at her over. So whether he was mad at her or
        mad at me, he was willing to leak that situation, right. As I explained previously,
        he is a man that sits there and prides himself on a moral standing and a moral
        compass, when in reality he has absolutely none. He''s a man that sits there
        and prides himself on having character, when in reality he has absolutely
        none. And then after I''ve already gone through an abortion, I was super young.
        When happen. Oh, it''s episode twelve of everything on the Internet is the
        wrong volume. Yes. Yes. King uploader. Unee aka v tv or v what? V one. V nine.
        Thank you. Yes. Yes. At no volume. Is this going toa be the sequel edition
        where my volume plugin also doesn''t even change the volume of the Twitter
        page? Wait, I don''t even know if I have that plugin anymore. I hope I don''t.
        I hope I don''t have it. Sound fixer. Here we go. I hope it kills the volume
        on the page. Yes, I hope it kills the volume. I''ve already gone through an
        abortion. I was super young when that happened. Like talking about mental
        health, abortion stuff and stuff like that. I think these are topics that
        a lot of people don''t talk about because they''re not normalized, you know,
        like, we don''t normalize people going through stuff like that. And it''s
        especially like abortion in a super young age. Like, we don''t talk about
        what that does to a person, you know, because, like, this is like, there''s
        some time pasted since that happened, and I still suffer from it. I don''t.
        I wouldn''t say that I was forced into an abortion, but you have to understand,
        my family never thought I would get children because I was the type of person
        would always talk against it, because when I came up to, I was like, yo, I
        have to tell you something. Like, I''m pregnant. They were like, oh, okay,
        when are you getting in a bush? You know, they weren''t openly talking about
        it. They were not saying, yeah, like, oh, I''m sorry. Or like, how can I help
        your. What you want to do? It''s more of that. They already were thinking
        that I made a decision within myself. Now think I should have thought more
        about it? 100%. 100%. Do I sometimes regret doing it also? Yes. But if you
        oversee the emotional part and just think for a rational financial part, it
        was the right decision. Did the dad want the baby? No, no. The claim is that
        this clip is from before the other guy, the so emotional. No, it''s fine.
        It''s fine talking about it. Yeah, but I find it, I find it really important
        to talk about things like that because especially in this type of age, I find
        that girls that have like, mental problems or get abortions or whatever, I
        still looked upon down on, and I don''t think that''s fair to them. Okay,
        so Tarzan didn''t leak anything? No, there''s, there''s a huge difference
        between somebody saying they had an abortion at some point in time versus
        leaking a specific abortion at a specific timeline with a specific partner.
        Those are two very different things. So even if she. If this is assuming this
        clip is not a deep fake AI, I''m assuming that. But like, this conversation
        here doesn''t mean that Tarzan didn''t leak anything, that those are two totally
        different things. This is very unspecified and very not related to any particular
        person. Like, would you ban Tarzan if you were twitch? No. What would you
        get? We banned people for leaking shit. Now rate the fits. Okay, what do we
        got over here? We got Jreg, the hat, the shirt. Fuck. I can''t rate any casual,
        casual wear. Are the shorts a little short? I think this is okay. I get this
        guy. Okay. Out of ten, I''d say u who is this guy? I feel like I''ve seen
        this guy before. Seems fine. Seems cute. I think it''s okay, right? I like
        the socks on vau''s thing over here. These are nice. That''s the next big
        thing. Oh, Matt binder. Oh, have I argued with this too before? I a whole
        bunch of reading on fucking wool socks versus cotton socks and everybody gets
        like ultra fucking has very strong opinions on never, ever, ever, ever, ever
        buying cotton socks ever. I can''t comment on the girls thingus. I don''t
        know anything about girl fashion. Also, I feel like if you say anything about
        girl fashion, I feel like it can count as a hate comment. So I won''t say
        anything. Love the brave. No broad tr yeah, I was gonna say you probably do
        something different, but I feel like, I don''t know if I''m allowed to comment
        on that without. Without it being like, hateful. Her fit looks trash. I wouldn''t
        say that at all. I think something more could be done up there. Je Smith is
        having a combo game with Andrew Wilson again tonight. What do you think about
        Bowman? Dont know anything about him. I think pv was sporting him for a while.
        Right. I feel like I looked up something about this gu a long time ago, but
        there are people that have sat there and they havesh actually interacted with
        one another in person. Oh, Jesus. Oh, yeah. Because it was the canvassing
        forboent event. Wait it so I''m whale watching today. Oh, there''s one might
        say if it''s jump on a whale and ride our way out of it. O there''s another
        one.


        D: Just see how high it is in the background.


        Destiny: But it''s weird because it''s different Al like it''s blue on it.
        But then there''s like it almost it''s black. The dishonesty of Candace Owens
        and an idiot for 90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance on Piers
        Morgan and she did what she always does. She refused to answer a single question
        in a straightforward manner. She dodged responsibility for massive claims
        she''s made in the past without a scrap of it. And she''s too much of a coward
        to come out and say it. And to me, this is frustrating because if you genuinely
        believe that Jews ruled world, then just have the balls to say, hey, guys,
        jews rule the world. Don''t do this dancing around where you start to critique.
        Wait, what is happening? Why do I''m sorry. Iistically notice every. How does
        the audio on the SM seven be here sound worse than the audio on this dky little.
        What is this? Like one of those DJI hand mite. Candace Owens is a coward and
        an idiot. For 90 minutes last night I watched her appearance on Piers Morgan
        and she did. This is pretty clean. Pretty good. But then the SM seven b we''ve
        got the whole room echo. What''s oh, fuck. Twitter video. Is it an overdub?
        That''s actually one thing I was considering. I almost asked in the beginning,
        but you hear the. There''s a little bit of like cricket noise or whatever
        the fuck in the background. But maybe he added that in via a coward and an
        idiot. For 90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance. I was thinking
        too. It seems like it must be an overdub ca becausee he''s moving the micro
        room, but it doesn''t seem to affect the sound at all. Do you think he added
        in post the background noises think he did that because it looks like. It
        looks like it was dubbed. Right. Candace Owens is a coward and an idiot. For
        90 minutes last night, I watched her appearance on no way. Right. And she
        did what she always does. She refused to answer a single question in a straightforward
        manner. She dodged responsibility for massive claims. Like, this mic is being
        moved quite a bit and there''s no difference in sound quality. It''s gotta
        be an overdub. It has to be. It''s gotta be dubbed. And he''s got a. And he''s
        got a mask on, but, yeah, he''s got a mask on and it sounds so clean. No way.
        Right. Is made in the past without a scrap of evidence. You can hear the wind.
        Yeah, but I''m thinking he might have added the wind in post, like, he might
        have added the background noises, like, just did, like a passive recording.
        And then he adds it in after. And then when the conversation doesn''t go in
        a direction that she likes, sher, the background is not real. Oh, do you think
        he''s just sitting in front of like a green screen or some shit? And then
        when the conversation does, I feel like the lighting go in a direction that
        she likes.


        E: She.

      summary: "### Main Focus\n\nIn this segment, Destiny is primarily engaged in\
        \ a critique and analysis of various topics, including a video featuring Candace\
        \ Owens, the recasting of characters in movies, and a discussion on physics\
        \ concepts. He starts by discussing the lighting and setup of a video, speculating\
        \ whether it uses a green screen. Destiny then delves into a critique of Candace\
        \ Owens, accusing her of valuing followers over truth and being unwilling\
        \ to straightforwardly address controversial topics, particularly regarding\
        \ anti-Semitic sentiments.\n\nDestiny also discusses the recasting of characters\
        \ in movies, specifically focusing on the transition from Terrence Howard\
        \ to Don Cheadle in the Iron Man series. He expresses frustration over the\
        \ lack of in-universe explanation for such changes and humorously debates\
        \ the differences in their appearances.\n\nThe segment concludes with Destiny\
        \ reacting to a video featuring Terrence Howard discussing mathematical and\
        \ physical concepts. Destiny finds Howard's explanations to be confusing and\
        \ somewhat nonsensical, leading him to explore the concept of absolute zero\
        \ and related physics topics in an attempt to clarify the scientific inaccuracies\
        \ presented by Howard.\n\n### All Topics\n\n1. **Video Setup and Lighting**:\n\
        \   - Destiny speculates about the use of green screens and the quality of\
        \ lighting in a video, noting the warm lighting that mimics a sundown look.\n\
        \n2. **Candace Owens Critique**:\n   - Destiny criticizes Candace Owens for\
        \ prioritizing followers over truth and for her unwillingness to address anti-Semitic\
        \ implications directly. He argues that she believes in Jewish world domination\
        \ but lacks the courage to state it openly.\n\n3. **Microphone Quality**:\n\
        \   - Destiny comments on the audio quality of a video, questioning the microphone\
        \ settings and the amount of room echo being picked up.\n\n4. **Recasting\
        \ in Movies**:\n   - Destiny discusses the recasting of Terrence Howard with\
        \ Don Cheadle in the Iron Man series, expressing his annoyance at the lack\
        \ of in-universe explanation and the noticeable difference in their appearances.\n\
        \n5. **Terrence Howard's Mathematical Theories**:\n   - Destiny reacts to\
        \ a video of Terrence Howard discussing mathematical concepts, finding his\
        \ explanations confusing and nonsensical. He humorously questions Howard's\
        \ legitimacy as a genius.\n\n6. **Physics and Absolute Zero**:\n   - Destiny\
        \ explores the concept of absolute zero and related physics topics, attempting\
        \ to clarify the scientific inaccuracies presented by Terrence Howard. He\
        \ reads about thermodynamics, enthalpy, entropy, and the ideal gas law to\
        \ provide a more accurate understanding.\n\n7. **General and Special Relativity**:\n\
        \   - Destiny briefly mentions general and special relativity, indicating\
        \ a potential interest in discussing these topics further.\n\nOverall, the\
        \ segment showcases Destiny's analytical approach to various subjects, blending\
        \ humor with critical commentary and scientific exploration."

      transcript: 'a direction that she likes, sher, the background is not real. Oh,
        do you think he''s just sitting in front of like a green screen or some shit?
        And then when the conversation does, I feel like the lighting go in a direction
        that she likes.


        E: She.


        Destiny: It''s. I mean, if he did. He did the lighting well and everything
        too, right? Because he''s got, like, this is like, warm. Seems like really
        warm lighting coming from what I imagine a sundown look under his arm. Virue
        signals, manufactured apathy. Now, any person with more than two brain cells
        can see what Candace Owens is. She''s a person who values followers more than
        the truth. And if what I just said bothers you or makes you angry, there''s
        probably a pretty good chance that you also think that Terrence Howard is
        some type of mathematical genius. And if that''s the case, you should know
        that. D that y.


        D: Honesty.


        Destiny: Okay. Right out of the gate, we get a pretty easy question. But instead
        of giving an easy answer, Candace Owens decides to start critiquing the meanings
        of words. Now, in my mind, there''s no real reason to do this, because when
        you hear a question like this, all that you need to do is simply say, yeah,
        I can see how Christ is king. How hot. How much gain do you think you have
        on this mic that he''s picking up so much room echo from an sm seven b. I
        feel like. I feel like the mic has to be so hot to get this. But then it would
        also sound blown the fuck out, right? Am I just wrong any what I''m talking
        about, it''s worse because he''re quitting this part live. It''s 100% d. Being
        in that whole debacle could have been construed as anti semitic. However,
        that''s not how I meant it, and then just stop talking. But she''s unwilling
        to do this because the core of the problem here in her mind isn''t the fact
        that there was a misunderstanding. The core of the problem here is that she
        genuinely believes that Jews rule the world and she''s too much of a coward
        to come out and say it. And to me this is frustrating, because if you genuinely
        believe that Jews ruled the world, then just have the balls to say, hey, God.
        Want them to mean, however, I am the arbiter of truth genocides on them by
        saying, oh, look, here''s some place against him. If you want to say something
        like you have insider information that the rest of Macron is who alleges,
        necessarily insult the power structures that literally hear him as much of
        it as she possibly can. And as that some right off the, okay, I like the shirt.
        Okay, what is the, um. Do I want to watch this or.


        C: Did you know how I figured it out? What''s one times 01:00.


        Destiny: A.M. i being racist? Or is this guy like a famous actor? Is that
        what he''s known for initially? He is, right. Oh, he was. Oh, the Iron man
        guy. True. Okay. I can''t believe they change you ever. Does it ever bother
        you when they change actors so deliberately and they just don''t say anything
        about it in universe? Why didn''t they just get a different guy? Why didn''t
        they just like make him a different character? It was seamless. And Iron man,
        they''re not even the same shade of black. What are you talking about, bro?
        We went from a caramel chocoly, you know, chocolate ice cream cone type black
        men to a straight, pure black, no shot. It wasn''t even close. These were
        completely different. Iron man one. I''m trying to think of the, what''s like
        a scene with him when he''s fighting the jets. Hold on.


        C: On the radar.


        Destiny: Got a minimal back in a global hawk in the area.


        C: So this thing just appeared out of nowhere.


        Destiny: We went from this to, let''s see, Iron man two. Party scene. Here''s
        where they lampshaded in Iron man two. Oh my God. Stop. 60 FPS upscaling videos.
        It doesn''t look good. It doesn''t look better. It''s not an improvement.
        Stop doing this. It''s stupid. Please stop doing this. God, it is so trash.
        Garbage. Stop. If you have to do anything with a video ever that involves
        the word interpolation. Don''t do it if the frame''s not there. The frame''not?
        There. Please, God, stop. Sorry. Okay, but we have to suffer through it anyway.
        Doesn''t he. Doesn''t he come in initially with the. Oh, there he is. No,
        he''s actually, you know what? ##uck maybe he''s not as black as I remember
        him. Don Sheetle. No, he''s Iron man. No, he''s significantly blacker. Okay.
        But in this, it''s a dark scene. You can''t tell. Okay? It''s different here.
        Don''t take this. Don''t take my word for it. Here, listen, we''re aborting
        this. We''re boarding this line of dialogue. Hey, buddy, you expect to see
        you here. Look, it''s me. I''m here. Deal with it. Let''s move on. I just.
        I drop it. All right, I''ll drop it. I have before me a complete report on
        the Iron man. Wait, this is where they lampshade it. Wait, how is that a reference
        to. That''s a reference to them changing the actors. How? Because he said,
        I didn''t expect to see you here or. You''re right. Here''s them together.
        Don''t get gas lit. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I was right. Thank you. App.
        Pure cinema. I don''t know how it cinema, but there was this one and then
        there was the Game of Thrones swap, where the most egregious, especially because
        in Game of Thrones are so many characters, I didn''t even know for, like,
        ten episodes that these were supposed to be the same person. I was like, oh,
        okay, caus.


        C: You know how I figured it out? What''s one times one?


        Destiny: One times one is one. I''m talking about for Dario. People who bring
        up the mountain are dumb. He turn it into zombie. Who cares?


        C: To multiply means to do what? To make more.


        Destiny: Right?


        C: Yes. Increase the number.


        Destiny: Yes.


        C: Multiply?


        Destiny: Yes.


        C: How can one times one equaling one be part of the multiplication table?
        It fails to satisfy the term multiply. It doesn''t multiply, does it? What''s
        an action? Times in action.


        Destiny: You got some wee?


        C: No, no, I''m.


        Destiny: Wait, this isn''t the one that all the dipshits in my chat were screaming
        at me to go to review a few weeks ago. Was it? Because this is seven months
        old? No. Reason.


        C: Reason.


        Destiny: Reason.


        C: I want you to reason. What''s an action times an action. A reaction, right?
        Have you ever seen an action times in actual a reaction? Have you no, because
        every. Because equanimity is the currency of the universe. There''s always
        an action timesion having a reaction. So how can one times one equal one?
        How can.


        Destiny: Terrence Howard is like a legitimate genius, like he said. Is it
        this? I think it''s this one. The Jo Rogan experience.


        C: Everything, all motion is expressed in waves. All waves are expressed in
        curves. It always makes spirals.


        Destiny: So because of the concept of gravity, and because of the concept
        of this event horizon, this super point of gravity, this infinite point that
        light can''t even escape, that this exists because of the.


        C: Of their gravity and their math. Remember, they have a thing called zero.
        They go from one to zero to negative one. There is no zero to even think zero.


        Destiny: So do you think that zero is a concept that came along with currency?


        C: It should be attached to currency in that regard? Because in physics, there
        is. It''s either. Nothing remains still. There''s nothing still in the universe.
        There''s nothing that doesn''t have motion, because everything is connected.
        So if one thing is ste. Everything that''s connected to it has to be stillel.
        There can never be one thing still. So as electricity tries to get to its
        balanced state, right? When it gets there, magnetism takes over and it pushes
        over. So there''s this pendulum.


        Destiny: Oh, God, this is going to be some schizo shit. I think what he''s
        saying here is technically kind of true, that nothing in the universe is still.
        Although I don''t know at what level he''s talking about, because technically,
        if there were absolutely no movements subatomically or anything, you would
        have, like, absolute zero, which implies a complete and total lack of movement,
        like, everywhere. Right? Although I don''t know if that actually is only classically
        in physics or if that manifests in quantum mechanics as well. Let''s just
        read, you know, what general and special relativity came out the day. You
        know, we might just do physics for like, 3 hours here. Okay, I''m curious.
        Fuck it. Let''s look. Let''s read absolute zero. Okay? I don''t know how much
        where this, but absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature
        scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach
        their minimum value, taken as zero kelvin. Thermodynamic temperature is a
        quantity defined in thermodynamics as distinct from kinetic theory or statistical
        mechanics. Enthalpy and thermodynamics. Enthalpy is the sum of a thermodynamic
        system''s internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It is
        a state function used in many measurements in chemical, biological, and physical
        systems. At a constant external pressure, which ismediently provided by the
        large what? Ambient atmosphere. Okay. And an ideal gas is a theoretical gas
        composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to inter
        particle interactions. I don''t. I feel like in chemistry, I learned something
        called the ideal gas law. What was that about? I don''t remember, though.
        Ideal gas law. What was that for? Was that for calculating something? I don''t
        remember what it was for, but okay. The fundamental particles of nature have
        minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy
        induced particle motion. What does. Zero point energy is the lowest possible
        energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics,
        quantum systems constantly fluctuate, and their lowest energy state is described
        by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore, even at absolute zero,
        atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion. Oh, okay. So I wasn''t
        sure if it was. If the absolute zero thing was just classical and not related,
        or it doesn''t go that deep. So I guess. So, in a classic'

      summary: "### Main Focus\n\nThe segment of the transcript primarily revolves\
        \ around Destiny engaging with complex scientific concepts, particularly those\
        \ related to quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and then transitioning\
        \ into a discussion about a humanitarian effort involving the evacuation of\
        \ a family from Gaza.\n\n### All Topics\n\n1. **Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics**:\n\
        \   - Destiny reads and tries to understand a detailed explanation of the\
        \ Heisenberg uncertainty principle and its implications at absolute zero.\n\
        \   - He discusses the concept of zero-point energy and how even at absolute\
        \ zero, atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion.\n   - The discussion\
        \ touches on quantum field theory, fluctuating fields, and the idea of an\
        \ ether in physics.\n   - Destiny expresses confusion and amazement at the\
        \ complexity of these topics, acknowledging his limited understanding.\n \
        \  - He reads about the ideal gas law, absolute zero, and the limitations\
        \ of classical mechanics in describing these phenomena.\n   - Destiny learns\
        \ about the Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales and the behavior of substances\
        \ as they approach absolute zero.\n   - He delves into the quantum mechanical\
        \ description of matter at absolute zero, discussing ground state energy and\
        \ the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n2. **Human Body Composition**:\n   - Destiny\
        \ questions the common statement that humans are made up of 70-80% water,\
        \ seeking clarification on what this actually means.\n   - He learns that\
        \ this percentage refers to the water content in cells, particularly the cytoplasm,\
        \ which is mostly water with other substances dissolved in it.\n   - The discussion\
        \ includes a brief explanation of cell biology, eukaryotic cells, and the\
        \ components of the cytoplasm.\n\n3. **Humanitarian Effort in Gaza**:\n  \
        \ - Destiny shifts to a conversation about a young journalist from Gaza named\
        \ La Jamus and a fundraising effort to evacuate her and her family from Gaza.\n\
        \   - He recounts the process of raising $100,000 and the challenges faced\
        \ in smuggling the family out of Gaza.\n   - Destiny shares the emotional\
        \ and logistical difficulties involved, including the temporary separation\
        \ of the family and the father's reluctance to leave Gaza permanently.\n \
        \  - He reflects on the complex emotions and the harsh realities faced by\
        \ the family, highlighting the pain and weight loss they experienced.\n\n\
        4. **Personal Reflections and Reactions**:\n   - Destiny expresses his frustration\
        \ and confusion about the scientific concepts he is reading.\n   - He shows\
        \ empathy and concern for the family from Gaza, questioning the decisions\
        \ and the future they face.\n   - Destiny briefly mentions his involvement\
        \ in a politics Discord server and his mixed feelings about participating\
        \ in it.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this segment, Destiny navigates through a dense\
        \ and intricate explanation of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, expressing\
        \ both curiosity and bewilderment. He learns about the behavior of atoms and\
        \ molecules at absolute zero, the concept of zero-point energy, and the limitations\
        \ of classical mechanics. This scientific exploration is interspersed with\
        \ a discussion on the water content in the human body, where Destiny seeks\
        \ to understand what it means when people say humans are made up of a significant\
        \ percentage of water.\n\nThe focus then shifts dramatically to a humanitarian\
        \ story involving a young journalist from Gaza, La Jamus, and the efforts\
        \ to evacuate her and her family from the region. Destiny recounts the fundraising\
        \ efforts, the logistical challenges, and the emotional toll on the family,\
        \ particularly the father's reluctance to leave Gaza permanently. This narrative\

      transcript: 'te is described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore,
        even at absolute zero, atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion.
        Oh, okay. So I wasn''t sure if it was. If the absolute zero thing was just
        classical and not related, or it doesn''t go that deep. So I guess. So, in
        a classical, mechanically understood system, even at absolute zero, for quantum
        mechanics, you would say that atom and molecules still retain some kind of
        vibrational motion, I guess. But maybe the overall sum of the energy comes
        out to be zero. In a classical system or something apart from atoms and molecules,
        the empty space of the vacuum also has these properties. According to quantum
        field theory, the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles, but
        continuous fluctuating fields, matter fields, whose quanta and firrmions,
        that is, leptons and quarks and force fields whose quanta are boinss. Bo right.
        Photons and gluons. Jesus. All these fieldills have zero point energy. These
        fluctuating zero point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an ether
        in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However,
        thisther ether cannot be thought of as a physical medium if it is to be Lorentz
        invariant, such that there is no contradiction with Einstein''s theory of
        special relativity. There might be ten different things in this one paragraph
        that I do not understand. Holy shit, how bored am I today? I won''t click
        all of these. I''ll spare you. The theoretical temperature is determined by
        extrapolating the ideal gas law, which is the equation of state of a hypothetical
        ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under
        many conditions, although it has several limitations. By international agreement,
        absolute zero is taken as -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, which equals
        -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. The corresponding Kelvin and Rakin
        temperature scales set their zero point at absolute zero by definition. I''ve
        never heard of rankine. I''ve never heard of this scale of my life. It is
        commonly thought of as the lowest possible temperature or lowest temperature
        possible. But it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real
        substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled, as they approach
        the change of state to liquid and then to solid. And the sum of the enthalpy
        of vaporization gas to liquid, and enthalpy of fusion, liquid to solid, exceeds
        the ideal gases change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum mechanical
        description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state. The point of
        lowest internal energy. Laws of thermodynamics indicate that Ep zero cannot
        be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the
        substances being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically.
        Even a system at absolute zero, if it could somehow be achieved, would still
        possess quantum mechanical zero point energy, the energy of its ground state.
        At absolute zero, the kinetic energy of the ground state, cannot be removed.
        Scientists and technologists, that''s a word, routinely achieve temperatures
        close to absol zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as Bose Einstein
        condensate superconductivity and superfluidity. Okay, based. Okay, back to
        this guy, right?


        C: When it gets there, magnetism takes over, and it pushes over. So there''s
        this pendulum, and as soon as it gets to this state, it bounces off that other
        noble gas, and it makes its way all the way back over here, and it''s about
        to have equanimity, and then it getsics over. It pushes over. So there''s
        this pendulum, and as soon as it gets to this, it bounces off that other noble
        gas, and it makes its way all the way back over here, and it''s about to have
        equanimity, and then it gets pulled back into the other direction, and that''s
        the breathing in and breathing out and the pendulum effect that we''ve all
        observed, the natural phenomena in the universe, and that''s.


        Destiny: A part of everything.


        C: Everything behaves that way. Every one of our cells comes down to. Our
        cells are made up of water, mostly water, 80%, 90% water. Somewhere, water
        is hydrogen. Hydrogen has twelve vortices that''s behaving with it. Twelve.


        Destiny: Wait. I''m actually curious. I''ve never actually questioned that
        before. When people say that humans are made up of, like, 80% 70% water. What
        does that actually mean? It''s not actually, like, h two o, is it? Are they
        talking about, like, the, like, complicated, like, poly carbon chains that
        have h two o in it? Or do they mean, like, just, like, straight out water?
        What does it mean, humans percentage water. When they say that the human body
        is made of water, do they mean actual h two o k water? Or does liid. In general,
        they mean actual water? Think of soda. It''s predinantly water, right? However,
        it''s got plenty of stuff dissolved in it. Cells are, and this is simplifying
        a lot, basically, water balloons filled with soda. You''ve got a membrane
        which keeps all of the soda in. The soda''mostly, water with the proteins
        and stuff your body needs dissolved into it. Oh, so, like, the inside of a
        cell, like, the cytoplasm of a cell, is mainly just water with other stuff
        floating in it. In cell biology, the cytoplasm describes all material within
        a eukaryotic cell enclosed by the cell membrane. What does this just mean,
        that has a membrane? Is that the difference? Eukaryes constitute the domain
        of ur organisms who cells have a membrane bound nucleus. Oh, okay. So their
        DNA doesn''t just float like a crazy guy all around the cell, close by. The
        cell membrane exc. The cell nucleus. The material inside the nucleus and contained
        within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The main components
        of the cytoplasm are the cytosol, a gel like substance. The organelles. The
        Ce sell internal substructures in various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm
        is about 80% water and is usually colorless. Okay, so that''s like. And that
        would be the majority of our bodydies. So when researching into things, do
        you begin to have a lot of respect for these people who have conceptualized
        these phenomenon? It''one thing to read, study, and learn these concepts,
        but at one point, they never even existed. Yeah, that''s kind of cute. Like
        the germ theory of cells. Wait, o am I doing this today? M doing a politics
        discord server thing today. It''s okay. Oh, God. All right, that''s okay.
        We''ll do this. Somebody tells wasos what I''m, like, sweating over here.
        I don''t know if you''re giving me, like. No, no. Yeah, no, I didn''t know
        what you were talking about. Okay, well, you told me that while we were driving,
        and it was the coolest thing that I''ve ever heard. So if you could please
        share it.


        E: I don''t want to give a shitty second hand verion of it.


        Destiny: Of course. No, you''re fine. So there''s a girl, she''s dubbed the
        youngest journalist in Gaza. Well, she was. Her name is La Jamus. You talked
        to her before. Yeah, I remember. It was a horrible fucking conversation. It
        was''about Israel Palestine. It was about something else. She''s just a random,
        like, copy pasted, woke dip shit, basically.


        E: And she basically just kind of took.


        Destiny: A camera and a microphone. She started speaking into it and she did
        journalism, and it was really cool. And her father reached out to my content
        creator friend and was like, we need to get out of Gaza. Because they were
        stuck in Gaza. They had no way out. And my friend and I, we fundraised about
        $100,000 for them and we evacuated her, her three siblings, her grandmother,
        her father and her mom. And it was an insane four months. We were, like, going
        back and forth. There were. Mom, $100,000. Wait, how much do you pay the illegal
        egyptian smugglers or whatever to smuggle people out of the Gaza Strip? $100,000.
        That''s where we thought it couldn''t happen. There was a moment where the
        father had to stay back in Gaza and the family, we had to smuggle the family
        through before we could smuggle the father. And that was also, like, a huge
        contention point within the family. Like, we had to separate them for a couple
        of weeks. It was a lot. And so recently I flew out to Qatar. Well, Qatar was
        my, like, my midpoint, but I flew out to Cairo to go meet them for the first
        time. And we were initially very excited to see them. But once we got there,
        we realized that it was actually, like, not a very happy moment because they
        basically had gotten a place to stay at. And the father told us, and he was
        like, yeah, I''m not planning to stay here long because we''re gonna go back
        to Gaza. And none of us have the heart to tell them, like, you''re not go
        back. You know what I mean? So was it was. What do you mean? Wait, no, I don''t
        know what that means. Wait, what the fuck is she talking about? First of all,
        when were these people smuggled out? Was it during the war or was it before?
        What? It was tough. Like, you could see the pain. Like, they had very visibly,
        like, physically lost weight. It was tough, but I''m happy we were able to
        get them out.


        C: Jesus.


        E: That''s genuinely insane, what the father said.


        Destiny: It reminds me, I saw these photos once of them were like, why would
        a white western random retarded dipshader has no fucking idea about anything.
        Like try toure leure. Anybody coming out of Gaza or anybody in any part of
        this region about whether or not they can u don''don''t link me this. I don''t
        want to read this. I don''t need be, I don''t need to get the trigger today,
        okay, stop. We were doing physics, okay? Physics less controversial. Back '
