       "\"Destiny: Oh. Algh. In the future, we will not do two supreme court cases in a row. Oay. Especially longerishh ones. I think these are longer ones, right? What do you think is like, the longest? Oh, shit. Dobbs with 200 plus pages. Careful. Don't die. Now, you said that debating Israel, Palestin doesn't reallyicit strong emotion because it doesn't affect you. Are there any topics you debate that really get you triggered or worked out? I think probably the more personal something is, the more. Okay, so, like, all of the America stuff gets me pretty worked out. Now, brown v. Board. How long was this one? Why is this not on the Supreme Court website? Do they not have it listed? Jesus, this must just be the syllabus or something, right? Or I guess actually this could just be as simple. It is so ordered. Maybe back then they didn't have, like, concurrent and dissenting opinions. Maybe. I don't know. Oh, Dred Scott is longer. They didn't have yappers back then. Gladiator two trailer. Can you make a sequel to that movie? Is that possible? Okay, hold on. 18 emails. I did all my messages. I just have to run these down real quick. Okay, don't care about this. RFK is wrong about DPTT vaccines. Unsurprisingly, he links some study that he says he misquoted. Okay, Michael knows. What is this? Are we looking forward to having blah, blah, blah. They drink while they do this. Showever's the lightest drink you've got. I'm a lightweight smiley face. Am I allowed to say that I like. Give me cocktails. Cocktails aren't girly, right? Is there just girly? Cocktails are girly. Like, is an old fashioned considered a cocktail. It is. Yeah. Okay. How many pages left in Chevron? I think you got like ten or 15 or something. That's not many. Schedule maintenance. Don't care about that. More shirts arriving today. Hell yeah. Archive. Boom. Ten. What is this? Okay. Hello. Damn. Wait, what is this car? Oh, this is the Lotus. I don't know, the back was so short. Oh, the lotus elite. Oh, Lotus is the make. No, the manufacturer. How much does this one cost, man? Some guy sent me an email. He's like, listen, bro, you don't care about any of this shit. You just need to go in and buy the most souped up fucking like, Honda Civic ever and you'll have more fun with it. I almost might agree. Enter a valid email address. Why is it say my email is not valid? Hold on O 1 second. You have periods in your. There's no way it would do that, right? No. Is there a space at the end? Nope. Oh, that time it worked. I'm almost positive I have an account here, but. Okay, good question. From Twitter alone, it feels like a large percentage of marxist socialist are trans. Why do you think that is transgender as a sexual identity? Got co opted by younger people as a. As an aesthetic or form of expression. So there are a lot of people who are in those crowds who ideas like non binary or whatever, because that's the way they choose to express themselves. So you're going to find a higher proportion of people and a very high proportion people and those crowds, well, identify themselves as such. Do care about this? No. Nokay. What do you think is a distribution of a genuine versus pretend people? You mean people that do the trans aesthetic stuff versus like actual, like people with transgender? Like as a. I don't know if you call it a sexual identity or what. My guess online is probably like 98 to two would be my guess, but. Oh my God. Bo boom. Boom. Just need to confirm it. You. Yes. Okay. How's life today in dgg world? Wa save boom. Nice forethought hate thread. Uh oh. Oh no. Please don't say the 1 second. What's your full take on Bernie, bro? It's 2024. I don't have a take on Bernie. Real quick, I hope the civil war starts, dude. In the United States, just so I can go after web developers. Why do some people have links on pages? Like when you hover over it, it has all the properties that you would expect of an ordinary HTML link, but they do some really weird JavaScript to launch the next page. So I can't actually right click and open it in a new window because you have to. Can somebody tell me what is deficient in HTML in 2024? That you can't have a link using HTML? Why do you have to do, why do you have to use JavaScript to have a link? So can somebody explain that to me? It's usually Ajax. Live loading is cancer. Oh, and nice. And since they don't even turn gray, so I don't even know if I've clicked the link before. Okay, beh, it's so bas, oh, I read that wrong. Holy shit. Okay, one sec. Oh, these are older. Okay, base o. Jesus. Okay. What I did, I tried to get test every few months to make sure I'm not dying of STD's. I don't know what. There's a couple of these I've never heard of anybody getting ever, but I'm sure they exist. The two big ones that most people talk about are sexually active are gonorrhea and chlamydia. Those ones have, they have like a huge transmission rate. I want to say it's like 60% plus in just one interaction with somebody. If they have either of those, get the fuck out of here. But there are two that you also pretty frequently get tested before. One is syphilis, which I have heard of people dying of it in the brains in the past, but I've never my life heard of somebody getting it. And the other one is, what is this called? Like Triga. It'like, it'got some weird name. It sounds like the name of a spider. Trichomoniasis maniasis. I've never heard of. Like, I've never heard of anybody getting either of these two STD's. Like, is anybod have any, you guys know? Anybody realized that that's syphilis? Does that happen? This lab also didn't test for hv, but they test for HIV. How weird. But we have no AIDS. Good job. Okay, well, that's good algh. Are you ever concerned about skin cancer? Melanoma? Mmm, not really. I don't really go outside that much. Okay. What is this? My God, she's a yapper. Joining a committee after watching for nearly a decade, since 1996, when they did welfare perform, there are a million restrictions put on welfare, which they now call Tanf. There is a lifetime limit on the program and it is 60 months. So five years total of your life, no matter how many kids you have that you can receive. Welfare. Wait, not true. Jesus. Okay. All right. T a n f. Rolling. For you to read my dono. Chessbox in YouTube. I don't even see you don'to up. Do you talk about the sketch stuff yet? No, I'll probably talk about it tomorrow night with Dan on anything else. Oh, and XQC will be there, or supposedly. Oh, ten minutes ago. Much love. With all the recent th principles under directions, do you ever think of going over old content on stream? Notes for past destiny from present destiny would be delicious content. Maybe. But the thing is, there are s so many, like, current people to critique. And if I go over my past stuff, I'm just creating like, a whole bunch of, like, stupid. Like, it's just gonna be like, there are already people that, like, clipped me from, like, eight years ago and like, oh, lookuck you'right, you've, you've been bought out because now you disagree with yourself. Like, eight years ago I was like, okay, u let's see. Okay, don't care about this. Let'see. Since you seemed so complimentary of Gorsuch's opinion, you might consider watching this video he did for the national constitution center. Personally, I found it one of the more enlightening views on the constitution and Gorsuch's view on the constitution. Maybe we'll watch this. How do you think they get this bokeh in the back? Do you think that this is done with AI? Like, or not AI? I'm sorry. Fuck. I just fell into the modern trap of calling every fucking thing done on a computer AI. Do you think that they use software to blur this or do you think that this is authentically. There's just that much distance and the f stop is that low? It doesn't look real to me. Yeah. Opportunity to discuss Chevron with Oregon Supreme Court justices. Hi, I'm a three l law student at blah bl blah. I'going to join a listen to this. I both agree and disagree with you. Regret to this, but listen to a couple of which are state supreme court justice. My e admin law statutor interpretation professor is a retired justice. Oh, retired, not current then. And another, who is currently on the court is, oh, actually, this would be an awesome conversation if either or both of them would like to chat. Yeah, that would be awesome. I'd have challenging questions for them. Not in any sense debate slash screaming match. But I'd love to hear them give strong takes on both sides. How do you deal with people like, policy ago being so smug in a conversation? I can't watch that conversation on YouTube without pausing it from pain. Usually in, like, conversations like that. Like, the debating part is kind of autopilot because I'm not going everything new. So I'm really just thinking a lot about the meta conversation. What do I need to do to control the flow of this? Like, how is this going to look when it comes out later? What can I do that wouldn? T be too mean? Like, it's just like a bunch of thoughts like that. Maybe since I'm more focused on that than anything else, maybe it helps to distract me a bit. But I've always been a really patient person. That'why I that's why I got promoted of that casino job so fast. Because I could deal with the drunks on night shift and not lose my fucking mind. Im'm not sure why I just have that. I'm just a patient person by nature. I don't know why. Counting this. Okay, give you some this blah blah blah, blah, blah. What are we doing? Most phys positions in residency, that is when doctors specialize in a given field, read journals, and are often PhDs in the same field. While it could be expected that physicians are only clinicians to provide the best available care, research is necessary. How would you know the outcomes of treatments and if the care you are providing is up to standards? New way toing very direct to the clinic as well. For example, if a new blah waah law and Sweden specifically, theres a lot of distrust of mies on the Internet. Probably due to the american sentiment against big pharma and the opioid epidemic in the US. Okay, cool. Boom. All right, what's your favorite type of naan to have with curry? I mean like garlic? Na is awesome, right? But I mean like even ordinary naan is good. I don't think it matters. Well, I mean, I mean I prefer more season, but I'll eat any na. Hell I'fucking non up. You're buying the Elise Elyra. Nope, no plans to yet. Can you please raise your volume a little? I'm looking at my bar. It looks fine to me. Eat shit and die. What country is in everyone? Destination of trumping was president. Probably whoever has the lowest taxes. I'm not sure though. U okay, okay. Boom, boom, boom. All right. Being a progressive who tries to find the state with the lowest taxes is such a bad look. Okay, so it's easy as including an href attribute in the link element so the browser can recognize it. Can you href JavaScript? I don't know much about. I don't know that much about programming, okay, and HTML is programming, my friends. It is programming. If you can do. If you've ever used Dreamweaver or any click and drag web page creator in your entire life? You are a programmer, right? Actually, if you've, if you've ever done like click and drag on a page before to make a website, you'a programmer. If you've ever published it and put it on the Internet, that makes you a software engineer. Okay? Don't let anybody forget it. In fact, it should go on your resume, to be quite honest. Oay, I'm opening packages and then you can listen to this. I you think the conversation around Biden's debate stutters are legit versus just trying to push a narrative. Everyone forgets how the man spoke the next morning. I mean, in some ways, it's like a, you, death spiral by pushing and reinforcing things that you think matter to other people, which also makes them matter to other people. But I mean, in other ways, it is a legit concern. Right. One thing that I'm really interested in. Hold on. I don't know how, I don't know how or why this happens, but somehow conservatives set the media agenda for everybody. Like they dictate the things that we're supposed to care about. I don't know how. I don't know why. I'm not sure. What do you think about save the vote act? And why would Biden try and block it? Wouldn't you want proven citizens to vote in elections? What is the Save the Vote act? Freedom to vote act? Is it this? No. 2021? What do we have? The SAE act would protect and preserve the right of american citizens to vote by requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote and requiring states to remove non citizens from existing voter rols. Do, does a federal government even have the right to do that time manner in place when we go over the United States, when we start doing us stuff, we are doing a full constitution reading. I think it's important we should, I don't know if the federal government is even allowed to dictate to state stuff like that. I'm curious what the constitutionality of this legislation would even be. But if they have like, a fully written piece of legislation, I would imagine that they ran it by like some legal person or something. I would imagine. I'm not sure. New socks. Wool socks are the best thing ever. Okay. Holy shit. No more cotton socks. I got a lot of them bazed bayeed. There's no way states could literally let anyoneone vote and the feds could do absolutely nothing about it. Yeah, that's my understanding. For how it works, but I would love to hear your opinion on it. Should non citizens be, when you ask me that question, there's multiple layers to that question. So the first question would be, do I personally believe that illegal immigrants should be allowed to vote as like a moral stance? There'two big conflicting interests. The first one is, obviously, if you're not here legally, do I want somebody who's in this country illegally to be voting against me? Right. So let's say I want candidate a, they want candidate b, and now they're voting against me and they're not even in this country legally. Do I want their vote to count? I mean, my feeling would be, well, you're not even a us citizen. Why the fuck would you have a say? Our electoral system, if you didn't come here legally? On one end, I'd be weighing that. And then on the second end, and then the countervailing end would be, well, if you're in this country, you're affected and impacted by the policies regardless. So you have an interest here. So you're voting to represent those interests. So it's a matter of, like, I guess you're voting to represent your interests, but should you even be allowed to represent your interest since you're not a legal citizen? I think I lean, I could probably be debated out of it, but I think I lean towards, like, on a moral level, I don't think an illegal immigrant should be voting in federal elections. I think you can make stronger arguments for voting in some types of local elections. But o, we got soap, liquid soap, always liquid soap. From a legal level, I think a state has the right to determine. I think a state should have a right to determine who's allowed to vote in their elections. If enough citizens in a particular state want to say that they are citizens or they'the, people in that state citizens are not. Should be allowed to vote. I mean, I think a state should have a right to make that decision, even if I disagree with it. I mean, states have the right to run their elections and the way that they see fit. I think I largely agree with that delegated rule. So personally, I think I would say no, but legally, I would support a state doing, I guess, what they'want. To. What the fuck is in here? Oh, this is the speaker for downstairs. And that's boring. Sh over there. I don't care. All right. ##an on media literacy, I do think with best of our ability, I do think on the topic of media literacy, with the increase in content, the opportunity for media literacy in my opinion goes down actually. Right. Like the vast quantity really explain. Wool is torture and everything. Piece of clothing. Why wool socks? I don't know if wool is torture or if it's like shitty wool. The thing that I read online is for socks wool. It wicks away moisture so you don't have like smelly, nasty feet. And, and because it wicks away moisture in hot weather, it keeps your feet cool. And then in cold weather it's decent at insulating so it keeps your feet hot. And it's just a good material that has like some longevity. I s a whole bunch of reading on socks and a whole bunch of people feel very strongly that socks should never ever ever be cotton. That there's never any point in buying cotton socks. It's either wool. Yeah, wool seem to be the most heavily recommended material for them. Wool doesnt t feel good on the upper body. I dont t know anything about other. I'just saying only for socks. Wool is what I saw recommended everywhere. But the. I can't speak to any other type of clothing. I will say for shirts now though, especially after buying. I bought every single color of these lululemon under shirts. This isn't one right now. This is a cotton shirt. The synthetic materials for undershirts seems like an obvious win win, no brainer. Well, maybe in other temperatures, maybe that good whatever material those lululemon soft jersey undershirts are made out of. Bro, even putting on this t shirt feels horrible. Oh my God. What is the material for this? That was a very roundabout to say no illegals voting. Why the mental gymnastics? What do you think? Mental. Okay, hold on. That comment was so fucking stupid in so many different ways. That was a roundabout to say no. It wasn't a roundabout. I was giving an explanation for my rationale, my answer. You should try thinking through your answers sometime. Okay. Maybe it would be elucidating for you. Okay. Number one. Number two, mental gymnastics usually implies when you are doing a whole bunch of work to put together absurd arguments to arrive at a position that you want to have irrespective of how you get there. I don't feel like any of my argumentation there was completely wild or out of line or anything. I think everything was pretty straightward. 88% recycled polyester and 12% elastin or elast. Elast synthetic materials. Prec clothing are horrible for the environment. The plastic fiberers never degrade and end up in the water system and then your bloodstream. Good. I will wear this until my body fully absorbs it. These shirts feel fucking awesome. Oh my God. Wearing cotton after this shit. These feel so good. Ellist stain. Okay. Okay. Yes. Our God Hasan, please talk to us about media literacy, please.\\n\\nB: Factually accurate information to the best of our ability.\\n\\nC: I do think with. On the topic of media literacy, with.\\n\\nDestiny: The increase in content, the opportunity for media literacy, in my opinion, goes down actually. Right. Like the vast quantity of headlines that we consume on a daily basis, or clips or long form, whatever we're consuming.\\n\\nC: As that quantity has gone up, I.\\n\\nDestiny: Think whatever your understanding is of the media will be applied across the board. Like, to have a nuanced take from clip to clip or headline to headline is extremely challenging and a challenging assumption of. Of society.\\n\\nB: Yeah, I think many.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you hand wash the wool socks? Something I started reading for taking care of clothes and stuff. So, one, ironing is good because it apparently increases the longevity of the class. But two, a lot of people do recommend, like, if you don't, a lot of people recommend hanging your clothes to dry. Fuck that. I'm not that intense yet. Okay. We're not doing that shit. Seemmely challenging and a challenging assumption of. Of society.\\n\\nB: Yeah, I think many people don't do that at all. And they don't have that. They just like are fed dis information they have.\\n\\nDestiny: They not even know they should do it. You might not even know that one.\\n\\nC: Headline is different from another headline.\\n\\nB: Yeah. No, that's why I think that we're arriving at like, one of my major goals is I look at the news and I hand hold you through it where I. If you are confused about what's going on in the world, my job, the way I see it, is like I'm there to be entertaining first and foremost, but also like, basically tell you, like, here's what the headline says, but here's what is actually going on. And here's what that headline might mean.\\n\\nDestiny: This is what. I hate this. I hate this so much. Everything Isana is saying here is 100% correct. That is true what he's saying, that it should be your job. But he doesn't do any of this. He doesn't do any of that. 1 second I get aud people that if you shower and you're getting in the same clothes afterwards, you might as well. Here. Life pro tip. Life pro tip. Save 30 minutes of your time, okay? If you're going to. If you shower and then you change into the same clothes afterwards, save your time by just not showering at all. Don't waste your fucking time. Okay? Don't waste your fucking time. Just don't shower. Who the fuck don't shower? If you're gonna wear the same clothes afterwards, don't waste your fucking time. Don't waste our time, all right?\\n\\nB: And sometimes it's, you know, the headline.\\n\\nDestiny: Is accurate, or the cat's still with you. No, honey is not my property. It's part of my girlfriend. She travels back and forth with her.\\n\\nB: That headline might mean. And sometimes it's, the headline is accurate, or the story is completely devoid of any sort of errors or omissions of details, right? But that is what Im trying to do. That is what Im trying to do when I look at Fox News. That is what Im trying to do.\\n\\nDestiny: When I see, I wish that, like, something that I started doing a lot, the thing that encouraged me to start writing more and thinking more about, like, media consumption and how people consume media. I just said the something twice. When I say media consumption, what I mean is, like, how do you read a particular thing and then how do you understand it? Or how should you understand it versus how people could consume media? Like, what do most people do? Or what are the main follies of most people in consuming media? I consider myself a subject matter expert, okay? And I think that from that position, I think I try to have a more critical view rather than just parroting things that I've seen online. This is why I push so much. Or you heard me say over and over again, like, when people say, how do you pick a good source? We'll just read a variety of sources. Like, no, that's an answer that is devoid of thought. Nobody's actually thought through what that means to read a variety of. So it doesn't mean anything people say, right? When you're in Hasan's position or my position, you have the opportunity to engage with a ton of different types of communities and a ton of different types of people and watch them consume media. Understand how media cycles work? Probably more than almost anybody on the planet, save for actual media pundits that work in mainstream media. And even at that, you have a unique perspective on things because you've got more direct engagement with media consumers than even pundits do, because they don't usually engage with media consumers.\\n\\nB: But that is what I'm trying to do. That is what I'm trying to do.\\n\\nDestiny: So there are much better answers to this question of something that I would say is, when you're trying to see if media is misleading you, something being right or wrong is not usually the important part. If you get into alternative media spaces, especially YouTube, you can just find a lot of stuff that's just wrongkay. Like, the rfks of the world is just wrong. But the big problem is when you're reading on reporting, things are selectively reported. People choose what things they want to tell you. And you can find things that aren't technically wrong, but they're not really conveying conceptually the most accurate picture, if that makes sense. Like a really good example was, we watched this the other day when the immunity thing came out. I think the headlines for, I think the left leaning stuff, I think people were saying Trump granted criminal immunity, stuff like that. And I think the Fox News headline was like, fuck, can I find this fuck? I don't know if these changed or the way, like, nothing from what I remember, and I only skimmed these articles, nothing in any of these Fox News articles was incorrect. Oh, so, like, right here, this focus on, like, this top line here, Chief Justice John Roberts says the president has no immunity for his official acts. I'm sorry, for his unofficial acts. Right? This is, like, true, right? Nothing that's reported in these articles can be untrue or false, but it can still be misleading. People should focus on that more. The reason why you should focus on that more is because the solution is in order to critically evaluate any particular media source, you have to have some kind of working knowledge of the material at hand, or else you're always just being led around by propagandists like Hassan, you know? But, yeah.\\n\\nB: But that is what I'm trying to do. That is what I'm trying to do when I look at Fox News. That is what I'm trying to do when I look at MSNBC, because I have plenty of disagreements with liberals as well as I do with republicans.\\n\\nDestiny: I think the interesting parallel between yourself and the New York Times is that, you know, the New York Times, I open the app every single day and I go straight to wordle and then play the spelling bee every day.\\n\\nB: That's great.\\n\\nDestiny: And I'm in. I'm in there. And then I'll quickly click on the news tab and I'm like, all right, here'some.\\n\\nD: Things that are happening.\\n\\nDestiny: And I will spend way less time looking at the headlines in the news, but I'm in. Like, you've brought me in New York Times. You got me. I'm in a news world, right? And I feel like with you, your beginnings were gaming on Twitch. And even still now, there is like, like you said, you're, like, having fun, right?\\n\\nE: Occasionally you do play games, and then.\\n\\nDestiny: There'S a news element as well, that it's this interesting thing that the news more so than ever requires this entertainment that may not be a part of it. So, like, this thing is a good example in chat. Destiny, doesn't the Trump presidency behavior from CNN disqualified then as a valid source? How do you explain the Charlottesville good people on both side stuff? I don't know from what platform a conservative can ever launch a factual grievance with any news source ever. But they are allowed to, right? I don't know how they dictate, like, the media agenda with that, like, screeching about Russia gate. For everything you have to say about Russiagate, the Hillary email stuff was like a billion times more egregious. And the Benghazi stuff. Right. There were no credible indictments. There was no valuable information turned out from either of those obsessive things that occupied conservative airwaves and brainwaves for years. But somehow. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure. People keep saying, like, offense versus defense. Maybe that's the case. I don't know. I'm not sure. I'll think about it more. I'll think about it more. I'll. I'll think about this more. Because it, I think it's worth considering, like, with the New York Times. But it's like, right there. It's like you need that, too, to bring people in for sure.\\n\\nB: I think I do it for not the revenue reasons that New York Times does it for, but instead I do it because I think it allows people to see me in a different light and not as, like, the serious news guy who's yelling all the time.\\n\\nDestiny: So on that topic of, like, revenue and business, like, the business of streaming the business, also of political commentary, I think it's interesting to break down, like, what does that look like? Because you brought up NPR at the beginning of the conversation, and I actually think what you do is similar to when I grew up, my brother, and, like, we were re like young kids. Like, when we were in the car with my mom or my dad, he wanted to listen to NPR, and I hated it.\\n\\nB: LA as hell.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, it's super lame. And I would make fun of him.\\n\\nC: For it, but he always wanted to.\\n\\nDestiny: Listen to it, so I was subject to listening to a lot of it.\\n\\nB: Your brother would have been a fan of mine if he was, like, know.\\n\\nDestiny: If it was, he was. I mean, my brother's like, speech and debate, model un. Oh, God, school. And then abandond all of it, went into fashion.\\n\\nB: So, yeah, that's awesome.\\n\\nDestiny: O he said debate. That's a trigger word for Hasan. Be careful. Yeah, but I grew up like, you know, he introduced me to Jon Stewart.\\n\\nC: But I grew up listening to NPR in the car.\\n\\nDestiny: And I think actually what you do, being live for that amount of time is more akin to, like, the radio. Yeah, right.\\n\\nB: No, absolutely. I, I describe what I do to people that are outside of the age range of understanding. Twitch as basically Rush Limbaugh, but not evil, if that makes sense.\\n\\nDestiny: I said that to Samir. Colin said that to me. Yester.\\n\\nD: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: When I listen to as sot, it has the same rhythm as Rush Limbaugh. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. So in that context, like NPR was funded by, like, it's public radios, it's funded by people essentially donating. Right?\\n\\nB: Yes'I. Think there's a tax component.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm not a conservative, by the way, but to argue the other side, CN reporting on the OKC bombing and Terence Yiki may suggest that they aren't a puppet of a secret conspiring elite. Check out the CN article. Why did this cop turn up dead? You know what we're gonna study on? Oh, I should have already done this. I'm gonna write this here for another note. This is what we'ren to be. We're just going toa read through all this list of shit. That's my ext streme for this month. Okay? You talk about a conspiring elite, okay? Like, and then you talk about Russia Gate and you talk about CNN and MSNBC. How about the fact that a sitting president managed to get legal counsel that was telling so many lies to the country about voter fraud and reaching out to other mainstream media outlet pundits to make them tell lies about it. And then those pundits, Tucker Carlson, told lies about it knowingly on the largest cable broadcast news in the country in order to help the president. I'm gonna win an election, but really steal an election, right? Like this. This is one of the most ripe for conservative, you know, to dwell on this for so long conspiratorily. But because it's involving conservatives, nobody cares. Andrew Tate. I bet if I were to bring up fucking Donna Brazil or whatever, I bet like Andrew Tate and Sneo be like, oh, the woman, was she the one for the DNC with Bernie? He might know about that. He had no idea about the Tucker Carlson stuff. How was that? Tucker did not do it knowingly. This is why I have this here to research this Tucker Carlson, Dominion Fox News suit. The message is that I saw made it look like he did know that he was tired of toing this line and that he was privately arguing with Sidney Powell that there wasn't good evidence for this. Tucker Carlson leaked texts. Sidney Powell Destiny read the comment again. I'm saying that the article suggest that they are not the propaganda wing of a secret conspiring elite dog. You don't understand just by you saying that that's unhinged. I'm not giving you credit for being like there's really strong evidence actually that Hillary isn't a secret lizard person. You don't get credit for that statement, right? Do you understand that like the default assumption is people are not part of a huge conspiring global elite without some kind of evidence being provided first, right? Great show so far. I know that b script is wordy but it came out great. It was awesome. Sidney Powell is lying. Fucking bitch. Jesus, I havent even read these messages. It is top article mediaite and also I sent to Breitbart, caller Examiner, New York Times a dude, nice job and a text ThR included in Tuesday's filings. The three host lamented that Fox'election decision desk director Arnon, Arnon Mishkin made the call and basachelor Colle is this the one where they called Arizona of is that what this is? Oh yeah. Why not bring this up to conservatives but remove political groups and names and see what they say. Then do the Scooby doo thing and remove the mask of it being Trump. I've thought about that'm. Yeah, it's hard to do it with the coup case. I'm sorry. It's hard to do it with the insurrection case though because like everything is so, so obvious, like what I would be getting at, would you approve? Like as soon as I say that, like their mind is be like wait a second, is he trying to get me? On November 5, in response to producer Alex Pfeiffer, who had written that, I really think many on our side are being reckless demagogues right now, Carlson wrote. Of course they are. We're not going to follow them. The sun will rise tomorrow. We want to wake up intact. I always think that in a message from November, Carlson texted a colleague that there was no doubt there was fraud in the election. But at this point, Trump and Lynn and Powell have so discredited their own case and the rest of us to some extent that it, its infuriating, absolutely enrages me. And Tucker was referring to Lynn Wood, another Trump lawyer. In a text on November 9, Carlson referenced Sidney Powell's Dominion claims commenting, the software shit is absurd. Carlson then said on television that night, we don't know anything about the software that many say was rigged. We don't know. We ought to find out. Per slate, around November 16, Carlson texted a producer that Sidney Paw is lying. Fucking bitch. He also called pal an unguided missile. Dangerous as hell in a crazy person. Quote, sidney Powell is lying, by the way. I caught her. It's insane. End quote. Like, if this was, if any of this was democrats, you'd be losing your minds, right? If Anderson Cooper was saying that there was a Biden press secretary who was just telling lies all the time, but then Anderson Cooper was going on a sandn in anyway and spreading those line, he'd be losing your mind. But, like, think you guys, I think you guys just bare your head in the sand on this. I'm gonna make Michael Nolles, he needs to answer this. How do you feel about Tucker Carlson knowingly pushing false inf? Or they just do the rhino thing where they just push, like, oh, actually, well, he's not a real conservative anymore, and then they just ditch him and move on. Maybe. Yeah, I don't know Jesus.\\n\\nB: Into it as well. Like, there's government grants, and then it's a funded by, by donors and also ad revenue as well. And I think that, like, creates a conflict of interest in many instances, which they, of course, immediately will reveal. They'll be like, we're. They'll do a story about Facebook, and then they'll be like, we're also fund to buy meta.\\n\\nDestiny: But, but yeah, that's youake conflict of interest is easily one of the stupidest. It's like one of the made for retard talking points. Like, if somebody says, like, come the inces, like, you, okay, remember, there's a difference between, like, red flags or orange flags and, like, something being outright bad. A conflict of interest is a red flag, at least an orange flag, potentially a red flag, but it doesn't necessarily mean something is bad. You have to say more, right? If you say, well, there's a conflict of interest here, and then you do more digging, you should be more critical. If something, the conflict of interest exists. But then you do more digging and you find out, like, did this conflict of interest manifest in a way that was damaging to the credibility of whatever's being reported on, then you can. Yeah, then you'd say, like, okay, well, this is a problem, but conflict of interest just gives you a place to. A direction to go. It doesn't necessarily discredit what's coming otherwise you could use conflict of interest to discredit anything you don't like. Which I mean, which is what they do. That's why what I'm arguing somebody about Israel, Palestine. And I bring up any news agency that has anything related to Israel in the name times of Israel, Jerusalem Post. These are fake's. Fake? Obviously. Fake is from Israel' like it would be the equivalent of. No, I can't even use that. Becausee conservatives would agree. It would be. I was gonna say it would be the equivalent of arguing some other. Somebody else in another country. And I'm like, okay, well, the New York Times, like New York. The us government published this. New York. But I guess conservatives actually do believe that in the, in the United States. So.\\n\\nB: Usually how it goes.\\n\\nDestiny: So outside of then that type of funding, like for you, that mix is funded by the people, right. So the people who watch you, they're funding you plus ad revenue.\\n\\nB: Yes. So the.\\n\\nDestiny: What if there's no smoking gun, but the person leads a fav of the conflict of interest 75% of the time? I mean, they could just be. Right. Right. You have to be able to do a factual analysis also. I don't. I don't think that you guys are, are the ones that should be tasked with that as well. I wouldn't expect an average person to like read through and scour all these fucking articles and all this shit. But we should, you should expect that of us, of people like Hasan or me, or Tim Pool or Ben Shapir or anybody else. Like that should be the expectation. But none of these people do. Well, I shouldn't say that about the other people. I know Hassan doesnt read anything. I dont t think Tim Poole reads anything. I was looking up Chevron stuff yesterday because I wanted to see if there were any horrendously off media takes. I watched that Michael Noles video. Most of the people seem to have an accurate enough. RTA seemed to have like an accurate enough assessment of what was going on.\\n\\nB: So the largest chunk of my revenue comes from subscriptions. I think that that is the most reliable, most sustainable.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. And then also. So someone in YouTube chat, bro, this was a good point, right? We can't trust any of these media outlets because they all have the same owners. You're telling me that you can't trust what a journalist writes because of who owns the company that owns, you know, like the Washington Post? So you don't trust anything from Wappo anymore because you think Jeff Bezos dictates to journalists what they write? That's what you think. You think Jeff Bezos, right now, maybe you're like, well, maybe Bezos doesn't dictate it directly, but he'll make his well known blah, blah. Oh, okay, sure, fine. Let's say that that pressure exists. How do you explain the fact that you work for a subsidiary of Amazon then? Because you work for Twitch and Twitch is owned by Jeff Bezos. So why would I trust your take when you say that the Washington Post is compromised? Because Bezos owns the company that owns the company that publishes these articles. But you're not like, why would I believe one or the other? Now you're about. And then Hasama, we give a whole bunch of reason. Well, no, well, I'm independent because I don't have anybody looking to directular for me. I can say what I wanted. I've got my blah blah. It's like, okay, well, why would't this apply to any fucking journalist? These people are the biggest tweeters in the fucking world, okay? These people run to social media anytime they're upset about anything. You're telling me that these people are all secretly being given marching orders and none of them have said anything about, like, come on. Yeah, I don't know. And to should frame a bit. And to reiterate, the reason why it's bad when people make these complaints is because there is problems with media reporting and there is problems, there are big problems right now with media bias. But I don't think it's because they're getting top down orders. The problem is that our cultures have become incredibly exclusive to outsiders. So you're ending up with these media rooms, these editorial boards, all these staff that are all of a certain political opinion. And because of that, you, one, you're over selecting for a certain type of idea or opinion. Two, you're over selecting generally for certain industries. Like, you don't have people working in the military or whatever writing for the New York Times and shit anymore, which hurts. It damages the ability for you to report on things in a fair, honest, objective, unbiased manner. But there'no, but you can't even have that conversation. You can't talk about that because it's like, why does the New York times or the Washington Post fuck up? Well, it's because Biden is telling them what to write. And it's like, well, okay.\\n\\nB: Way of doing this business in general for someone like myself.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, because I don't want, is it the same case with Murdoch? Fox News doesn't have quite a bit of pull in the GOP if it was. Here's what I would assume. If Fox News publishes things that Murdoch likes or agrees with, my guess would be that if you go to Fox News, that's probably the culture in their newsroom. I seriously know there's a bunch of people fox'like, fuck. Like, I really don't want have to publish this. My evil boss is making me publish these conservative things. A lot of people work. They're probably link conservative, that'be my guess. Probably not as conservative as their viewer base. Just because they work in media and entertainment issuesives. They're probably slightly not. They're slightly moderated, but most of them probably roughly agree with what's being published.\\n\\nB: Want to be beholden to advertisers. And especially considering the way I do commentary and what I talk about in many instances, there's always going to be so much volatility if I'm hyper focused on ad revenue. But that doesn't mean that I don't have ad revenue. Of course, ad revenue has played even a larger role on Twitch because I think Twitch, as a platform directed by Amazon, wanted to generate more ad revenue because they saw that that was better overall. The splits were better for them and they had a better way of, basically they had too much inventory and not enough monetization on inventory. So they really made an effort to push for ads. So that's something that I have to do as well. Contractually obligated to do as well. And beyond that, there's sponsorships. They can be, you know, multiple year long sponsorships that are more holistic, like a brand partnership or a one off. And for me, I spend most of my time, my manager, you know, God bless him, he's, he's great. Spends most of his time basically telling people, like, we're not going to work with you. But, but overall, you know, I'll play like a video game every now and then, and that'll be sponsored and.\\n\\nDestiny: By the game.\\n\\nB: Yeah. By the developers.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. By the publisher. Yeah. I mean, because the reality is like.\\n\\nC: I mean, we're all in the business.\\n\\nDestiny: Of being credible to our audiences, right?\\n\\nC: Like, that is the most important thing.\\n\\nDestiny: You can be as a creator. Okay, I don't know what this is. Okay, this was this, this guy. Maybe we'll watch this later. Don't care about this. These guys are starting a new media. And what was the cause of this new venture? Breaking Points family news, which is Ryan, is launching this morning drop site. We've got a graphic for that. Go ahead and tell us, Ryan, what you were up to here. And what was the cause of this new venture? Yes, the headline here is that Jeremy Skahhill, who you see up on the screen here, and I, are leaving the intercept. There will be some other intercept veterans who are joining us at this new venture that's dropsitenews.com dot. You can find it over there. Any names you can tell us yet on that others? Nosca Renner, who is a deputy editor, she'll be joining us. The others still have to tell the intercepts. Okay, so we'll let them play out that process. I'll be rolling them out in the next couple of weeks. But you guys followed this as I was kind of running you through the whole saga. But it's been reported that there was a staff revolt about the direction that the new board management were taking the intercept. And as part of that, it was also reported that Jeremy and I tried to take the intercept over. And in hindsight, it was kind of a crazy idea, because we went to the board and we said, look, we've got funding, we've got a vision for the intercept. And we proposed that all of you on the board resign, go away, and turn it over to the journalists. Yeah, boards don't normally agree to things like that. Qu they contemated. Got a little bit of experience with this in most situations. I think we understand. Yeahah. I'm not sure we even got a second for that motion. But in any event, they said, no, thank you. But we realized at that point, if we could do it here, then we can do it elsewhere. And to me, it's extremely important, especially for the independent media ecosystem. That's something like the intercept exists, that you have to have an independent investigative news outlet that is able to punch above its weight, that is able to push back not just against politicians and expose what they're doing, but also the MSM, the New York Times. New York Times is so dominant now, they got rid of their ombudsman. The post is barely competition at this point. There's nobody to check them. When I was reporting on some of their propaganda around, he's talking about the fake ripes. He doesn't believe that any of the rapes probably happened on October 7. By the Wayus, there weren't enough rape murder invasion survivors. October 7, I was talking to a New York Times reporter who was there, who was like, who's gonna check us? Like, she had nowhere to go internally anymore to, like, even when they did Jason Blair, when there was that massive, like, scandal, they investigated it. A bunch of people got fired. Like, it was real problem. They, like, cared. Was that caliphate? Which scandal? Which scandal was that? Jason Blair was the guy whohate there was caliphateeah. But each successive scandal, like, with the weapons of mass destruction, there were some consequences for people at the time with Jason Blair, who was fabricating stuff. Consequences, caliphate, fewer consequences. She still works there. This time around, they got rid of a stringer. Right. But publicly, you can still change narratives, even if the times is, like, gonna dig in. Like, there's enough weight in independent media now that you can kind of push back in a serious way. So we're building this as kind of a new intercept, and you and Jeremy have such a track record and so much credibility. That's part of why I know this venture is gonna be extremely successful. And you're so right. Is it Scotthill, this Jeremy guy, I think, was also one of the writers on. I think he was one of the writers on one of those stories about how the New York Times expose on the big rape stuff was horrible reporting. Think. I believe he was one of the authors. I think it was in the byline. Right? There were three journalists. It was Ryan Grimm, himm, and I think it was one other person. It was pronounced Skahhill. Okay. Because. And I hope you guys will go to what is it? Drops sitews.com and support this venture, because it is more difficult to do investigative journalism in the independent media space and have that work as a business model, because sometimes you're engaged in investigation, and it doesn't work outl and then all of that work that you've done is for naught. And so you need people who do you think they know what they did with the rape stuff. Are they evil? Are they evil? I don't know. But when you start citing people like the Gray zone and Blumenthal, which I believe they did for at least one of their articles, and who are invested in that long term project of media, corporate, political. What are the motivations to write that stuff? I don't know. I don't know. For a lot of these people, I'm not sure. I wish I could get into their brains and check. Yeah. They say the squirrel. I was just gonna say it reminded me of. It circles back to our bias talk. I remember one of the things they cited in there, in one of those articles was, there's a company called, is it the Middle East observer? Is it the Middle East? I it's a pro. No. Or is it media something? It's a pro Israel, like, watchdog or something. And what they do is if they feel like there's an article or a publisher that's like misrepresenting Israel, they'll send a notice in. They'like, hey, you got this wrong on this story. We think that this is not fair. And I remember they cited that in one of their articles. They were re like, you can see how much influence Israel has on the media. And then they cite this thing. Like, these people send things to everybody. And I guess if you read it, you don't think about it. Oh, memory. Maybe it's memory. If you really don't think about it for a microse, you're like, oh, wow, that sounds bad. But then it's like, well, hold on. Are the corrections that they're sending in true or false? Because, like, if. Let's say that all the corrections they send in are things that we would agree with. I mean, is that even a bad thing? Wouldn't we want people to be sending in corrections? Like, yeah, obviously they're looking out for their particular interest, but we'd expect that as well. And then we clicked through. I don't know if they made a particular reference or if I googled to find the first thing that came up, but the. I think the first story that we found, or literally, it might have been. It might have been what they were referencing here was a place where memory changed. How they talked about some soldiers shooting something. There was a picture. God, this would be so much more powerful. I could remember the article if anybody has it. There was a picture of a soldier shooting. And I think the caption was like, it was something like a soldier opens fire and fires into a crowd or something. It was something like that. But the soldier. You had no way of knowing this from another picture. The soldier was shooting. They were shooting beanbags. They weren't shooting live ammunition. But if you looked at the picture and the tagline, it looked like, oh, shit, this guy's just, like, fucking, you know, with a m 16, like, killing, but they were shooting non lethal rounds. I was like, okay, well, I feel like that's whether it's good or bad, significantly different than the perception that I got from this picture. But fuck, I wish I could remember this original article. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Was I doing debate prep notes yet? No, I don't think I was. Fuck. Yeah. It was like. But after looking at that correction, I'm like, is this. Like, this isn't a bad correction. I think, like, this is fine. That was during the college protest a little while ago, too. Yeah, maybe drop Sitenews dot comt on the record with Hamas. In a drop site news exclusive, Hamas officials discussed their motivations, political objectives, and the human costs of their armed uprisings against Israel. This reality poses uncomfortable but inelectable questions. Ineligable. Hello? Oh, okay. Inctable. Unable to be resisted or avoided from home. From Hamas perspective, was Operation al Aqxa Flood a successful operation? Hamas undoubtedly knew that israeli retaliation would include the killing of many palestinian civilians, even if the horrific scale of Israel's assault was unforeseen. Was October 7 then a collective martyrdom operation launched without the consent of 2.3 million Palestinians. And for the many people who proclaimed their support for the palestinian cause but reflexively condemned the violence of the October 7 attacks, how can they realistically separate the two? Conducted a series of interviews with senior Hamas officials. This article is way too long. Fuck this. I don't have time to read this right now. None of what I read so far looks bad, though. That might be a good article. Not sure if you actually are getting interviews with mo officials, but I don't know's time this right now. Somebody said, add it to the blacklist. I wouldn't blacklist this site before, like, reading it and getting horrible information off of it. Oh, this is. We're looking for this. Who is that fault here? I started wa. With that shaggy here dude recently. I wish she would asked him if he looked up. If he looked into the amount of internal affairs cases and the success rate. I don't think he looked up anything. Read the Heretz s article about the Hannibal directive. I read it yesterday. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's not really anything new or compelling in there, except for one claim that somebody. Somebody said that there was a communication to do Hannibal directive, which would be the. I guess, the strongest new claim that I've heard about that. Although I don't know how that communication went out. There's only one person that talked about it at all. But I don't know. Your haircut is damn goy go shall.\\n\\nB: You the go po shock of n the.\\n\\nDestiny: You boyy. You dear boy l.\\n\\nB: The ma all.\\n\\nDestiny: What is this? How does info like that only come into existence eight months after the fact? Yeah, I'm like. I'm pretty sus. I seriously doubt there was, like, a media or not a media. I seriously. There was, like, a comms that went out where it's like, erets crossing Hannibal directive now. Like, I. I mean, im not saying its impossible, but it seems unlikely that that would just be getting reported now. Jesus. Gladiator two trailer. 25% of israeli casualties in this war are blue on blue. That's war, and that's not uncommon. It's just a reality of combat. Is it? That seems like a really high number to me, but I don't know if that's a function of Israel just being really reckless or just that Hamas doesn't have the ability to damage israeli soldiers much because of their superior operational capacity or. I don't know. I't read into why the friendly fire seems to be so. Wait for the Denzel in a historical movie. Um. Oh, no, he played. He did. Um, was he Malcolm X? I shouldnt say historical. Sorry. Ancient movie or whatever. Wait, was the first gladiator, was that based on anything real gladiator movie? Anytime I see names like Maximus decimus Meridius, I just assume, oh, there was probably some roman fucking. I have no clue. Not really. Okay. I remember that day. I never forgot it.\\n\\nE: But a slave could take revenge against an emperor.\\n\\nC: Where were you born?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't know. I never knew a mother nor father.\\n\\nC: You will be my instrument.\\n\\nDestiny: Who are you? It's as historical as Troy. Okay, I could be wrong, but isn't ever, isn't every single thing in the iliad fictitious? Like, are any of those places even real? Where the fuck to the battle? Is Troy even a real place? I thought all of that was fake. My. I I don't remember. Trojan war was a legendary conflict. Greek mythology took place around the 12th or 13th century Bc, low stage. That gives the city of Troy. Is this a real place? Troy was an ancient city located in present day hearik, turkey. O okay, it was real. Did u was there actually, like, a big war battle here? I thought that everything in the Iliad was just like old Testament biblical stuff. Athens was real in Sparta, sure. Yes. But I don't know if. If the ancient battles and if everything's spoken about and was Atlantis real or not, without googling, like the lost city of Atlantis, the one that exists underwater? I don't believe so. Okay. Hard to know for sure. Den cell s character name. Character's name is chattiest. Ggus. Shut up. The current consensus is probably not. Troy was real. And there were battles that have taken place over the 600 year history of Troy won to Troy the fourth. Hmm. Okay, I bet Dustiny thinks Pompeii was real too. Wait, the volcano that. Wait, that was real? Wait, I can't tell. I'm getting cholled or not. The people that got buried. Right. Wait. Oh, buried under volcanic ash? Fuck you. Guys. Okay. Why? How long has it been? Was inception of the first movie that had that blah. People are still doing it. Who are you?\\n\\nC: Did you hear that crowd? The greatest temple Rome ever built. The Colossum. Because this is what they believe in.\\n\\nDestiny: Power district nine started it. General Acasus Vict man, I don't know if I'm an asshole. Or maybe he had other movies. Ridley Scott seems like one of the biggest like hit or missdirect directors of all fucking time. Holy shit. He's got a lot of stinkers. U alien was obviously legendary and it's good to this day. Blade Runner was good for its time. Boring dog shit movie. Now no one cares. Gi Jan in the movie. I never watched this. He did gladiator obviously. Everybody knows this. I never watched Hannibal Blackhawk down. Okay. American gangster. God dn okay, nevermin hold on. It seems ive treated you too harshly, my friend. Because I hated Prometheus so much. That was me. I'm so sorry. That was me projecting my hatred of Prometheus onto his entire filmography. My bad. Oofn covenant. Did not like. Did not like. The last duel was okay. House Sauci I never saw. But this had a huge all star cast. The duel is legitimately or the last duel. This is a good movie to watch like a child. Like if you're going to watch this movie, go in with no spoilers. One of the few movies that I will say no spoilers. If you go in not being spoiled, you can enjoy it like a child enjoys a jack in the box. Because final confrontation is quite. But if you know that outcome. Yeah. Which I would say definitionally makes the movie not that good if it's just relying on a particular shock or surprise. But three is yet still to come. Rome has so many subjects. She must feed them. They can eat war. The arena turned slaves into gladiators. The gladiators into free men.\\n\\nC: You have something.\\n\\nDestiny: I knew it from the start. Did you now? Rage that wages your gift. That's not fair. Shutter island relied on a huge mind fuck. And it's objectively a masterpiece. Listen, I love you. And there are some things that me and my audience will never agree on. And I understand that. In my opinion, if a movie is good, it doesnt matter if youre spoiled or not, you should still enjoy the movie. Shutter Island, I think is a good movie. Now, personally, I like Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor. I dont care that he plays the same character in every single fucking film hes in. I like him as an actor. I think hes got good performances. I think everybodys performance in Shutter island is good. I think its a good movie. Whether youre spoiled or not, you should be able to enjoy Shutter island. There is a kind of a mind fuck or a double mind fuck, I guess, but it's still a good movie. It's a great movie. Algh, this is a bo survival, survive.\\n\\nB: Together.\\n\\nDestiny: And when it charges, break for the wall. Wait, you think Leo and Shutter island is the same character as Leo and Wolf of Wall street? Okay, listen, if you wanted to challenge me, you could have down a better example because, yes. Is Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter island an eccentric, but intelligent and sharp, but ultra paranoid, but, like, super driven, but also, like, running from his problems. But like, yeah, the Leo and Shudter island can literally be a copy pasted person of the same type of guy who's in the wolf of Wall street. Yeah. What do you mean? Not that this takes anything away from Leonardo Daprio. I like Leonardo D. Cario. Okay. Matt Damon plays the same character in every action movie too. Okay.\\n\\nC: Whose head could I give you that would satisfy this fury?\\n\\nE: The ant entire roman armies.\\n\\nDestiny: Too much.\\n\\nE: The general will do.\\n\\nF: There's no way you think those are both the same character.\\n\\nDestiny: It's, yeah, I think so. Yeah. Think you basically can swap one for the other.\\n\\nF: Okay, isn't Jordan whatever the fuck his name is? Like, debauchress and fucking insane. And like, the, the guy in Shutter island, isn't he like an honor bound detective? Like, core aspect of these characters are in complete opposite directions now.\\n\\nDestiny: Debaucherous and insane. And isn't the guy in Shutter island an honor bound detective?\\n\\nF: Yeah, like, he's, I don't know, dude.\\n\\nDestiny: He'S like, on Bo, when I say that the guy is honor bound in Shutter Island, I don't know if I ever get that impression from the detective. He's just a detective. I don't know if I would say he's honor bound. I don't know.\\n\\nF: To me, I can't tell if it's because of himself, but to me he has, like, a drive, right? And though I haven't seen that movie.\\n\\nDestiny: In a while, he does have a drive.\\n\\nF: Yeah, but to me that comes from, like, a sense of, like, I can figure out whatever mystery is going on here and I can bring, like, justice, but maybe I'misremembering the movie.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, and Shutter island, that he's trying to figure out something or he's trying to, no, he, yeah, like, he's on.\\n\\nF: To these fucking people that are lying to him clearly right there.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but not because he's got some, like, pure drive as a detective to solve a mystery, but because he feels like he's kind of being fucked with and like, there's just, there's strange shit going on that he can't explain and he's on this job and he's gotta do this. But I don't think it, I don't think that's a character where you would watch him. I like, man, he's gota a pure drive to do, like, detective work. I don't think that you really have that feeling from, if you were to watch the character in Shutter Island. I don't think you get that feeling.\\n\\nF: Gotcha. I'll have to rewatch the movie to come back to this, but in my opinion, there's definitely similarities between the characters, but they're, like, in, I don't know, surface level stuff because they are both, like, sly characters. They are characters that have, like, the means to get stuff done. They have like, a drive. Both of them do. Even though Jordan feels more like a scumbag who just wants to get away with making as much money as possible and just fuck everybody else along the way. But those are surface, I don't know. I have to rew, watch the movies and then yell at you for that.\\n\\nDestiny: So you don't think that in Shutter island, you don't think you could make theoretically, like, similar ish.\\n\\nF: But I feel like those similarities are like, they're not core to the character. I think they are, like, flourishes. Right? I don't know, I don't know what the terminology would be to the writing of the character itself, but I'm pretty sure those are the way they carry themselves, but not the core of who, like, they are. Right, but you're right, it could, here's.\\n\\nDestiny: Like, let s so, like, I would say, okay, so, like, let me, I'm just gonna write some stuff. Okay, so you have a driven character. Okay. So he very much has a particular purpose. Right. A thing he is oriented towards. Right. He is highly capable and has the tools to get this particular thing done. However, he's also running. He's, well, he's simultaneously, as he's working towards his mission, running from or ignoring some key aspect or major character shaping thing in his past that he hasn't really come to terms with. So I feel like, as a general thing, I think this fits the Shutter island guy.\\n\\nF: Yeah, but do you think it, it's Jordan, like, Jordan is running, but he's literally running just from, I don't know, like authorities u and, yeah, but it's not just authority.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, he's running from authorities, but it's also like the authorities in a way, I. That kind of represent his own hubris to some extent, right?\\n\\nF: Yeah, but I. Fuck, I have to rewatch both of those movies. But to me, Jordan's the kind of character that would see that, right? And I don't even know if necessarily. No, you might be right. Hold on, I need to think. Cause I'm thinking of the scene where he is going to leave his own company, right? He turns around, he says, like, fuck it. If he was really, really running, right, he would have fucking left. But if you're talking about his hubris.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, but Leo's characters, when they run, they run in like a way where they're coming, where their problem is always still in front of them. Like they're always, as they run from their problem, they're confronting it kind of at the same time. So for Jordan Belfast, right. Like, in a way, he's trying to escape, like, the criminal activity, but he's also, like, always, like headlong into the criminal activity. And it'like, he's like building this viidge in front of him as he tears it down behind him at the same time. And Shudter island, he's like trying to run. His mind is constructed this thing to get away from the past trauma. But he's investigating his. Jordan Belford or whatever. Sorry. But he's investigating, like, this crime that's also, like playing into his delusion the entire time. Right? In inception, he's running from the bad things that happened with Marv or whatever, his ex wife. But he's still working through dreams and having these conflicts that are having her pop up at the same time, like, throughout the entirety of the movie, right. I feel like for a lot of Leo's characters, it's like this type of character composition and then, like, the things on screen and theitor, everything. Everything play out, like, pretty similarly. It's not like the exact same, but, like pretty similarly. I think somebody says the same thing, the great Gatsby. But I didn't watch that.\\n\\nF: Gotcha. I mean, I'll give you this. Maybe I got caught up on semantics. Because if you're seeing he's typeecast for u traits of somebody who has u, who is running and he has, what you gonna call it? U, I don't know, he's being chased after some level of regret and things like that. Because even in Shutter island. Like, he clearly has regret. He just doesn't fucking remember right until, like, the very end of the movie. I can definitely agree with that to some degree. I might be retarding, be getting caught up on the fact that you're saying the exact same like a fucking retard maybe. Okay. But I I, yeah, I can see.\\n\\nDestiny: What the acting is also pretty similar too. I don't wan people use typecast as an insult, but there s that. There's a lot, I think. Absolutely. So in terms of, like, how Leo acts, he's generally, like, he's always, like, a sharp witted guy. Okay, so meaning like, witty tongue, very insightful, somewhat like he's always, he's always kind of hiding something. Like if I imagine even in like, django, like, the kind of character there, the Django, Leonardo DiCaprio has a lot of similarity with, with the Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo Dicaprio. Would you agree or no?\\n\\nF: F can you repeat that? My headphones cut out for a second.\\n\\nDestiny: In Django, the Leonardo DiCaprio, the acting, the demeanor and everything is like, very similar to the Jordan, Belfast, Bellford, whatever. Okay.\\n\\nF: Yes, yes, yes. I can agree with that. Yeah. For sure.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. I don't think this is a bad thing, by the way. Like, one of my favorite actors all time, I think, is Denzel Washington. I think hes, he plays basically the same character in like every single movie almost.\\n\\nF: You think he's gonna play the same one on fucking gladiator?\\n\\nC: I don't know.\\n\\nDestiny: That's why it's hard to imagine. But, like, man on Fire is basically the same as american gangster. Basically the same as all the fucking the time movies. The equalizer, whatever. Same as a training day. Like about. Yeah, he's pretty typecast as well. I think most actors are fairly typecast, but.\\n\\nF: Gotcha. I think this would be fun to revisit after I watch both movies, but like I said, I have to watch both them, so.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, I'll let you. Did you see the movie viarium or whatever?\\n\\nF: I heard the name, but I don't. That's not coming to mind. Is that a Denzel movie?\\n\\nDestiny: No, no, no. I think it's a Netflix. Mayvbe we should watch it. I hated it, but you should watch oay. Yeah.\\n\\nF: Does have birds on it. I'm making a joke. C becausearium sounds like a thing birds would be on. And they're always tripping on the background. I figured you were doing like a dig, but I'll watch it.\\n\\nDestiny: I'll watch it. Oh, wait, is that what is a vivarium a real thing?\\n\\nF: I I think so.\\n\\nDestiny: Because it would make sense if that, if what you just said was true, that would actually make sense for this movie.\\n\\nF: But I thought you were making a dig at me, but. All right, you need to watch Frey and you sick man finish on her hunter, and then you can get started on that.\\n\\nDestiny: I think I got, like, 30 episodes of Hunter Hunter left.\\n\\nF: Holy shit.\\n\\nDestiny: Really?\\n\\nF: Okay. Now that you. I don't know how far into the chimera ant you are, do you really feel like it'sressive like people say it is?\\n\\nDestiny: Well, I think they're just getting back to Gohn. Just got the 30 day interest machine taken off him, I think. Okay, okay, okay.\\n\\nF: But for, for all the hype that people give Chimera ant, how are you feeling about it so far? Is it like, me, not that big of a deal? Or is it like, oh, shit, I can really see why people hype this up so much.\\n\\nDestiny: I think it's pretty cool. I think when you start to get, like, older characters from a series coming back and then you start to see, like, everybody, like, stacks up to each other, I think that's pretty cool. But I don't think I've. We haven't gotten to, like, the main thrust of it yet. Right. I think the queen lady just kind of died. Spoiler alert. Oh, okayeah. So I think that it's. I think it's about to take off or enter it. Yeah, big part.\\n\\nF: All right, well'll let's you get back to your trailer and then I'll come annoy you later.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Oh, wait, one more thing. Have you seen the movie sold like Pixars? Yeah.\\n\\nF: Or this? Yeah, I saw that movie. I have some mixed feelings about it, but overall it's.\\n\\nDestiny: Why.\\n\\nF: Yeah, overall, it's like a good direction. I just don't like some of the side characters. I like the overall message. I'm a sucker for anything, any themes to do with, like, passion and purpose and why you do what you do.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nF: Like, people seeking, whether it be like arts or sports or whatever it is, I'm just a sucker for movies that speak on that necessarily. U I I just thought that some of the side characters and the side plots kind of made it not fun for me. Like that detective from heaven that's trying to figure out, uh, why that, like, little lost soul is with the dude. I don't know. I just wasn't really vibing much with that specifically. It wasn't necessarily bad. I feel like it did spend a lot of time on that, it was a little bit distracting. But aside from that, for the target audience of, like, children, it's really good. I feel like the themes are not what you usually see in kids movies. Right. Like, it's something new, in my opinion. It is cute. The designs are more unique relative to, like, Pixar or. I can't tell if it was Pixar or Disney or if it was both of them. I don't remember y. But I know that a lot of. Yeah, I know that a lot of complaints that people have with Pixar is that a lot of shit looks like U Frozen moana kind of has a frozen feel.\\n\\nDestiny: T. Oh, maybe. I never watched frozen, so I don't know. But.\\n\\nF: But they all have, like, a similar look when it comes to their character designs. And this one had more unique character designs. I remember when it came out, a lot of people were talking how they were trying to do, like, this dumb representationhip by making these characters have more, like, afro centric features and whatnot. But it was more unique, and that was really cool. So in the visuals department, that movie was also pretty good. Themes were awesome and unique for children. What else was there? Writing was good for kids.\\n\\nDestiny: I just.\\n\\nF: Yeah, I didn't like part of it. That's how I feel about it overall. It was. It was okay. It was like a seven out of ten. I'd give it for like a kids movie.\\n\\nDestiny: It was pretty good. Okay. Yeah, I thought it was cute. Yeah. All right.\\n\\nB: Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: Finish.\\n\\nF: Hu watch freen.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, no, I'm not actually. Fuck. You left. I am not watching.\\n\\nF: Did you just say you're not? What the fuck?\\n\\nDestiny: After Hunter. Hunter? Why after Hunter? Cuz after Hunter. I'm watching the Sopranos. I need to watch that show. Okay, then after that, maybe I'll think it. Okay.\\n\\nF: Okay, sir. Yeah, can wait. You haven't seen. Oh, you've seen it through clips, haven't you? You're one of those motherfuckers who've seen the entire show through.\\n\\nDestiny: In't seen the entire. Seem like I've seen quite a bit, but not, not enough to really understand any part of, like, I think Tony Soprano seems like he's the leader of a big crime family and. M hmm, that's about all I know. And I guess he has depression too. And he goes to a therapist. I don't know anything else, but, yeah, that's all I. I want to make.\\n\\nF: Fun of you, but I've only seen that fucking show through clips too, so I'll also have.\\n\\nDestiny: Why not watch it. What the fuck?\\n\\nF: I'll fucking watch. I don't know.\\n\\nDestiny: There's.\\n\\nF: There was succession that came out around time that people were telling me to watch Thepranos. And I heard that was really good. I just haven't had the time, okay? Same as you. Probably you haven't had the time, but now you do. So you'll watch it.\\n\\nDestiny: I ll you careful and then we.\\n\\nF: Can talk about it.\\n\\nDestiny: Mama. Prepare for disappointment. Destiny. Half the show is really fucking boring family drama. Oh, man. I hate to say this to you, my friend. Maybe it'because I've gotten older, so now I'm boring. But that doesn't sound boring at all. Finish the trailer. I don't give a fuck about this movie. I need to only give it a push. Oh, the Denzel laugh all right, all right. Tes on the mausoleum floor blood stains.\\n\\nB: The co of seem do.\\n\\nDestiny: This ring belonged to Maximus now I give it to you. What is the dream of Rome? People are not free.\\n\\nC: I was owned now I will control and Empul.\\n\\nDestiny: He's got the Denzel Caaden still another.\\n\\nC: Generation of young men for their vanity another.\\n\\nDestiny: Why is rapping this trailer? Well, because the coolest thing you can do for an action movie is have some epic orchestral score, but then find some way to work like a poppy or rappy thing into it. It's like if you're doing a horror movie, what you need to do is you need to find some poppy track, but then you either need to add like a children's choir or like creepy like string noises. Actors at are typecast are more trustworthy because they don't have the psychopath ability to truly pretend to be different people. Okay. Okay. Desin, do you like Charlie Kaufman movies, like being John Malkovich and Syneecticke maybe? No, actually I really, really, really, really, really like Syneecticke New York. I watched it for when Adam was coming here. What a movie I thought about watching I might watch. Becoming, isn't it? Is it being John Malkovich or is it becoming John Malkovich? Um, yeah, I don't know. Damn. You'seen Jojo Rabbit? Yep. That was a cute movie. Where life is beautiful. I don't think so. Who's the most versatile actor you know of u? Christian Bale actually has a really wide range for popular actors. And then theres also that one actor that everybody brings up. Fuck, I't even remember his name. Gary Oldman. Yeah. Detective actor in Batman, isn't he the detector? Why doesn't Gary Oldman come up here. What am I thinking of? The right guy. No detector. I'm sorry, detective. No, I did. Wait. I put detective shut fuck off. Daniel Day Lewis is also good. Um, yeah, I feel like o this might be a really unpopular take. I wish that Daniel Day Lewis was in a better movie. Was in like a movie where I could get a more emotional impact from his acting. Like, ive seen there will be blood. It's a good movie. I think, undeniably it's a good movie. I watch gangs of New York. It's also a good movie. Undeniably so. But I feel like if he was utilized in a movie that had something that was a little bit more emotionally grounded for me, that he could give, like, a really good performance. I just haven't seen any movie like that with him in it. I didn't see Lincoln or Phantom thread. People are saying that. Did you ever watch in Bruges? Yeah. That's a cute movie. Destiny plays the same character as a retarded fucking criticism. Most actors act the same in every movie. Somebody says earlier, I never gave it as a criticism. I just said it was a thing like, you heard me literally say, I like Leonardo DiCaprio. Ill probably like almost any movie Leonardo dabrioses in just because somebody used typecast. Its same thing with Denancezel Washington does typecast doesn. And I make them a bad actor or something bad people say Christoph Waltsz plays the same character in Django and bastards. Would you agree with that? Yeah. I also think he has a very similar type character that he plays in a lot of movies. But I also like that actor a lot as well. Um. God, Django is shot so well. Fuck, I've been watching a lot of Django clips. I love little stupid rules. Quentin Tarantino will break dumb rules just for, like, effect. And it's so cute. It'so well done. Fuckributes. It's the one where he's riding away on the horse and he shoots him. I think there's two big times in this movie where he. He does like, stuff with blood that doesn't even remotely make sense. Or like, with recoil that doesn't remotely make sense. U it wasn't evenjango that shot him. O fuck. What am I thinking of? Django brothers killed Butina else any harm? Yes. You sure that's him? Yeah. Positive?\\n\\nC: Oh, no.\\n\\nDestiny: You don't know if you're positive?\\n\\nC: I don't know what positive to mean.\\n\\nDestiny: It means you're sure.\\n\\nC: Yes.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, what? Yes, I'm sure. That's Ellis brittle, right? Like the shot doesn't. What?\\n\\nC: Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Britle.\\n\\nDestiny: The shot doesn't work in terms of continuity. If we're seeing him going horizontal across the screen, and we're getting a shot here, we wouldn't expect it to come through like this. It doesn't make sense, right? But who cares? It makes her an awesome shot. Obviously, you get your blood on all your things. Whatever. There's another thing here, where he horizont, there's a. Everybody knows it. Like the horizontal fucking recoil. Fuck, I shouldn't even would I search to find this who ends up getting killed. What's her name? Lady shot house. Django. Yeah, I think everybody knows this one a lot more. Oh, yeah.\\n\\nC: Now, all you black folks, I suggest you get away from all these white folks. Not you, Steven. You right where you belong. U Cora, before you go, will you tell Miss Laura goodbye?\\n\\nDestiny: Do what now? I said, tell Miss Laura goodbye. Bye, Miss Laura. Yeah, there's a lot of small. I say a lot, actually. These are the two that I remember. The first one of, the second one. This movie is shot so well. There's so many cool shots. Fuck. Okay. I hated the hateful eight. Maybe if I rewatch it, maybe I'll appreciate it. I really didn't like that movie. I saw it in theaters and everything, and I hated it. Who knows? How do you fight the mail in ballot memes is the walk back from election fraud. Oh, I wrote this one. When, if you don't like the election processes in a state, if you wait to challenge those processes until after an election, you're always going to look really, really, really bad. One of the reasons why, as if you want to sue somebody, like in court. So, like, civil litigation, not criminal. One of the reasons why it's good to send a cease toist first is because when you go to a judge, a judge likes to see that, oh, you've tried to resolve this manner outside of the courts before. You've brought this before me to waste my fucking time. I shouldn't say waste was his job. Right? But you'brought this before me to ask for, you know, the state to give some kind of judgement here. People like to see, judges like to see that you've taken time to try to resolve the matter first. One of the big issues of a lot of the court cases that Trump's campaign was doing is people were challenging, like, they were challenging these election processes in these states. But it was after the election, and then after the votes had been counted, that counts against you. So fucking much in terms of it looking like a good faith challenge to any of the actual regulations or statutes, I guess, laws of some of the states had passed. That hurts, number one. Number two, the second thing that hurt for a lot of these cases is a lot of the court cases weren't being filed and then followed up on in a timely manner. So there was the one that we looked into, Pennsylvania, I think in the last debate we had, I think whenn Z Suey was in here. And I think it's a district court. I think it was filed in a district court. Yeah, the federal court. The district court looked at this and it was like you had this notice to file for this long and you didn't do it until this. Why did you wait so long for this? Why are you waiting so long for this? Why are you waiting so long for this? That was the thing. And then the third thing was the remedy that was being sought after was incredibly high in most cases. So, for instance, I think some, I'm wrong on this. I've got civil litigators in here. If I go to a court, if I go before a judge and I say, my, I have a tenant and he moved out and he didn't pay rent for, you know, one month. And because of that, I have suffered so much mental harm, I am now suing him for a million dollars. I don't know if you can do large, you must be able to sue for a lot of money in civil court. Yeah, you can. I think there's a chance that, or let's say, or let's say not even that, I'm sorry, not a dollar amount, because the judge might be able to just turn that down. Let's say that you say because of this, I want. Well, what else can you sue in civil court for before, besides dollar amounts? Well, let's say it's a million dollars. I think if the remedy that you're seeking is unreasonable or too great, I think that the case can also get tossed on standing. They jud will to say this, the remedy is not the injury that you've claimed that you've had. The remedy either wouldn't relieve it or it's just so unreasonable that's not going toa be considered. And I think that was an issue that in some of the Trump cases, there's a whole publishing of, it's like twelve conservatives got together and they published their review of a lot of these cases, and they went through a lot of these. And you can go and you can click through and you can read the filings on them. But for a lot of it, it'll be like, there'll be a somewhat minor issue. And then the relief that Trump's counsel was seeking was to change the entire election result or to toss out every single vote in the state. And when that's the level of relief that you're seeking for Accl claimed injury, it's just, it would be so out of whack with anything that you would normally, any kind of relief you'd be granted. But, yeah. Destiny chooses to ignore this again and again. What am I choosing to ignore again and again? They tried to do it before destiny. It's called a Google search. Where and what thing? My understanding is that for there were, I don't remember the states where this is involved in. I don't remember the deal in her a long time, that for a lot of these states, they had passed changes to how they did the voting stuff way before the election. I think in some cases, maybe a year or more before the election, and if they wanted to change them, like, immediately before the election, they had the opportunity to do so, and they just didn't. Do you have to prove damages of a valid defamation libel case? I think in order to take somebody to civil court, there has to be some relief that the court can offer. You're not just going to civil court to say, like, I want to prove that this guy is a big fucking asshole. The court has to be able, you have got to prove some kind of injury that the court can assist you in getting a remedy to. I believe, I think it's part of the qualification of filing suit. Right? So if you file a case against your wife because she lied to you, and you ended up going to a Thanksgiving dinner, and she promised that her in laws wouldn't be there, and they were all there, the court can't help you because there's no. How can the court help you? There's no relief that I can give you there. But if you can, and then if you go and somebody desecrated a grave, I don't know if you can get relief for that either. Maybe if you can prove, like, emotional damage or something. There are some types of cases where I think you don't have to prove damages because it's part of the, because the thing that you're attesting to is so bad that there is, like some damage assumed. I've spoken to lawyers about this about, and it's called, is it defamation per se? Is one example of these things. You can win this case without even proving damages. And then I think the damages might be assessed after by the judge or something. Defamation per se is a legal presumption that a false statement has harmed a person's reputation and that the plaintiff doesn't need to prove actual damage to win. It's a type of defamation claim where theamatory nature of the statement is clear on its face. Court sometimes called defamation, say, statements libel per se. Yeah. Somebody asked what the conservative thing was. Let's see. Can I find this? It was my debate. No debate prep with Alex Jones and Greenwald. It was on the. What would I have had this? Did I save a link to this? I don't think I did. Probably google it. Conservative judges, politicians evaluate Donald Trump election fraud cases. Oh, it's this. Lostnotstolen.org. there you go. I think these guys walk through a lot of the different cases and go over why they were tossed, basically. Oh, we can finish that. Sorry. Goal. Accountability. And as I said, you and Jeremy certainly have the track record to back all of that up. That's right.\\n\\nE: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: It's not commercially viable unless people support it. Like it has a cause un long, people want it to exist. The topic of today's show is why you need drop site. I mean, to your point about the New York Times, we're going toa go through some of the media coverage. But that's such a great point. If you've been disappointed with the coverage, as you watch, you reflect on what happened in the debate. That's why you need Ryan. Great. It's been great out there. They were totally upfnt with everybody. Fantastic. And I love the name, the homage, you know, the idea, the spy like a drop side g. Wait, what was the implication here? The topic of today's show is why you need drop site. I mean, to your point about the New York Times, we're going to go through some of the media coverage. But if that's such a great point, if you've been disappointed with the coverage, as you watch, you reflect on what happened in the debate. That's why you need Bryan. Great. It's been great out there. They were totally upfront with everybody. Fantastic. And I love the name, the homage, you know, the idea of the spy like a drop. I giving information that actually gets back to the roots of the interceptction. So we are very encouraged to actually see something like that back. What it really should be. Exactly. And we're happy to have that breakingoint.\\n\\nG: Thank you.\\n\\nDestiny: Ryan drops sitew.com everybody go subse I link down the description for prem subscribers a link in the email as well. You're going toa hearing about it quite a bit over the next couple of months. Yesgratulations.\\n\\nC: We're very happy for you.\\n\\nDestiny: Breaking point. Just souile like me. Lincoln clips okay. Okay. What do you want? What do you want a Peter, hi. Quick, quick. Maybe disagreement or maybe you're just not.\\n\\nF: Aware, but are you, have you seen.\\n\\nDestiny: Trump like talking shit about Biden and.\\n\\nF: Dropping out in Camla Harris coming in.\\n\\nDestiny: On the golf course?\\n\\nF: Because that's like, that's a huge talking.\\n\\nDestiny: Point in my opinion. If he's happy about it, that's, I.\\n\\nF: Don'T know what else needs to be said.\\n\\nDestiny: Um, I understand the argument and I've heard it. Maybe I'll use it in the future. But youre saying, the argument that youre putting forth is that Democrats would be foolish to run Biden. They really need to replace them. It its very obvious this that he needs to be replaced. But Trumps reaction to a potential replacement of Biden is one of like exuberance or joy. So the argument would be, well, if Trump is super happy about the prospect of replacing Biden, isnt that kind of strange? Shouldnt he be more afraid of that or shouldnt he be saying that like, well, maybe Biden should stay in? Sure. Yeah.\\n\\nF: And there's two sets of calculus that are like directly opposing coming to the same conclusion that it would probably be bad for Biden to drop out. So not only is Trump happy, but he's also directly motivated to, you know, be either unhappy or happy.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. Maybe. Yeah. Cool. That's a, that's it. Thank you. New toe song this was drawn with AI. I can tell why to tr use keyboard shortcuts on YouTube like up down for volume space per play posuster because I'm going back and forth between two different computers with my mouse o I'm using a program that helps me go through two different computers when I'm moving my mouse from side to side and then when I'm coming back to my main computer, it's hard to know where the focus is for my particular mouse. So if I push a shortcut and I'm on the wrong computer, it's just going to open or do random shit. If I over on this computer and I push a thing, I don't know what my is currently second should easier to click on the window even computer or monitor. How, how much of a tech boomer am I that I would say two different computers when I mean two different monitors. Do you think? I think that a monitor is a computer. What's a software called to show the mouse? It's called synergy. Why don't you use mouse button three instead of right click to open in a new window? Sometimes I do, but the middle click of that mouse thing is sometimes moves the mouse. When you push it, it's a little bit harder than just like clicking. Like the clicks are like it's an adty bitty click. Whereas you have to move your whole ass finger. And then sometimes if you're pushing the wheel, you might move the mouse up or down a little bit. It's not as precise as just like clicking. Why do you see these two computers when NBeNC is pretty good? And considering you aren't gaming anymore, that it'going to be because it's just one. It's nice to have all my shit sandbox so all my goonning stockpile of preubescent dragons doesn't open up on this computer. And two, that's one. Number two is because it's still nice to have separate computers for performance purposes. I don't want to have a stream that just like looks okay, right. One thing's running it as high capacity as possible. So if I'm sending out like multiple streams or anything like that, if I'm on one computer, it could be bogged down, which is fuck annoyinge. We'll go with those two for now. If I did play games or whatever, it's also nice to have a computer. Maybe we'll go back to games. Who knows? Maybe they'll stop making by FS PSa making forethought tired is a ban worthy offense. Try to remember this. This leak from Biden's campaign. Is internal polling the only price you brought up? Michelle Obama refuses to be president. So it doesn't matter how well she pulls. It also doesn't matter how poorly Biden pulls at this point because you haven't brought up a candidate par against. Sure it'd be great if generic Democrat would run, but this isn't a person. Also a presidential she'run ban for illiteracy. Poor thought. I dont think you can be just banning people for disagreeing with you. Oh no. Hes falling into Janney syndrome. Dont do it. Forethought. Fight the urge. Only I can ban people or disagreeing with me. Yes o and then somebody like this.\\n\\nE: They may ask, you've been pretty close with Donald Trump.\\n\\nDestiny: Your private texts about him around the 2020 election were made public. In one of them, you said you passionately hate Trump. When that came out you said that.\\n\\nE: You actually know you love him. So how do you explain the difference?\\n\\nDestiny: You know, my text reflect my current emotional state at the time. I was just mad at the time. I was frustrated at the time. But that isn't mean that I always feel that way.\\n\\nC: A lot of things, including how I.\\n\\nDestiny: Feel at the moment that I sent them that specific text, I happen to.\\n\\nC: Know since I had to go through.\\n\\nDestiny: Ok iay I'm good. Okay all right I'm going to okay its going to take us 30 minutes to finish the Supreme Court case, then we well do the America thing and then were'going to start reading on. I think the first thing we'do is the Iran hostage negotiation. Oh, I might put together a template for arguing the insurreaction thing because I think I want to be conservatives over the head with this. Give me a minute'be.\\n\\nF: Like.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, were going to speedn this. We can finish this quickly. We have less than 20 pages left. All right. Similarly, Congress has declined to to enact proposed legislation that would abolish chevron across the board. So the extent the majority is worried about the chevron presumption is fictional, as all legal presumptions in some sense it has gotten less and less so every day for 40 years. Congressional reaction shows, as well as anything could, that the Chevron court read Congress right. All the majority principal arguments are in a different vein. Around 80 years after the APA was enacted and 40 years after Chevron, the majority has decided that the former precludes the latter the APA. Section 706, the majority says, makes clear that agencies interpretations of statutes are not entitled to deference. And that provision, the majority continues, codified the contemporaneous law, which likewise did not allow for deference. But neither the APA nor the pre APA state of the law does the work that the majority claims. Both are perfectly compatible to Chevron deference. Section 706, enacted with the rest of the APA in 1946, provides for judicial review of agency action. It states to the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action. That text, contra the majority does not resolve the chevron question or said a bit differently, section 706 is generally indeterminate on the matter of deference. The majority highlights the phrase decide all relevant questions of law italiaizing the all, and notes that the provision prescribes no deferential standard for answering those questions. But just as the provision does not prescribe a differential standard of review, so too it does not prescribe a don de novo standard of review in which the court starts from scratch without giving deference. Isn't all court judicial a palate review? Isn't all of that usually de novo like, isn't that by default or. My understanding is that's the assumed start. But in point of fact, section 706 does not specify any standard of review for construing statutes. And when a court uses a deferetial standard here by deciding whether an agency reading is reasonable, it just as much decides a relevant question of law as when it uses a den novo standard. Hello? Hey, got a second u fuck. Can you give me like 20 minutes? You just finish this so that this doesn't get dragged out for 20th day. Yeah, sure. Okay. The deferring court then conforms to section 706 by determining whether the agency has stayed within the bounds if its assigned to discion, that is, whether the agency has construed the statute it administers reasonably. We do not ignore 700 six's command when we afford an agency statutory interpretation Chevron deference, we respect it. The majority tries to buttress its argument with a stray sentence or two from the APA's legislative history, but the same response holds as the majority notes. The House and Senate reports each stated the section 706 provided that questions of law are for courts rather than agencies to decide. In the last analysis, Jesus, he's footnotes. But that statement also does not address the standard of review that court should then use when a courters or defers under Chevron, it reviews the agency's construction for reasonableness. In the last analysis, the views of Representative Walter, which the majority also cites, further demonstrates my point. He stated that the AP would require courts to determine independently all relevant questions of law. But he also stated that the courts would be required to exercise independent judgment in applying the substantial evidence standard, a deferential standard if ever there were one. He therefore did not equate independent review with de novo review. He thought that a court could conduct independent review of agency action using a deferential standard. Okay. Section 700 six's references to standards of review and other contexts only further undercut the majority's argument. The majority notes in section 706 requireseretial review for agency fact finding and policy making under, respectively, a substantial evidence standard and an arbitrary and capricious standard. Congress, the majority claims, surely would have articulated a similarly differenttial standard applicable to questions of law had it intended to depart from d novo review. In another part of section 706, Congress explicitly referred to de novo review. With all those references to standards of review botheretial and not running around 706. What is telling is the absence of any standard for reviewing an agencys statutory constructions. That silence left the matter, as noted above, generally indeterminate. Section 706 neither mandates nor forbids Chevron style deference. Passage indicates a deferential standard was preferable. Preferable? Wait, what's going on with my background? Why does it look so weird? Wait, really? Hold on. Scoob and playbook DC today Nikki Haley is releasing all of her 97 delegates and encouraging them to vote for Trump of the range. Niki Haley, however, was not invited and will not be attending the RNC. Wait, really? Damn. Maybe that'll change. Maybe they just haven't sent the invites yet. In a footnote, responding to the last two paragraphs, the majority raises the white flag on section 706 text. Yes, it finally concedes, section 706 does not say that de novo review is required for an agency statute. Our construction, rather, the majority says some things go without saying. And Dean Nova review is such a thing. But why? What extratextual considerations force us to read section 706 the majority's way? And its footnote, the majority repairs only two history, huh? In cont of the majority, most respected commentators understood section 706 in that way as allowing, even if not requiring deference, the Fin. I mean, that's a big difference. The finest administrative law scholars at time, or of the time, call them that, generations manning, sunst, stain and vermle. These are apparently important legal people, or historical people certainly did. Professor Lewis Jaffe described something very like the chevron two steps. Two step as the preferred method of reviewing agency interpretations under the APA. A court, he said, first must decide is a question of law, whether there is discretion in the premises. Judic control that is akin to step one. Did Congress speak to the issue or did it leave it? Did it leave openness? And if the latter, Jaffe continued the agency's view, if reasonable is free of control. That, of course, looks like step two. Defer if reasonable. And just in case that description was too complicated, Jaffet conveyed his main point this way. The argument that courts must decide all questions of law as if it were no agency in the picture is, in my opinion, on sound. U j who is this guy again? Hold on. Oh, he's a law professor. Hmm. Okay, I guess. Questionable, I guess. Decided to just a law professor for this, but okay. Similarly, the professor Kenneth Culp David, author of the then preeminent treaties on administrative law noted with approval that reasonableness review of agency interpretations in which courts refused to substitute judgment had survived the APA. Other contemporaneous scholars and experts agreed they did not see in their own time what the majority finds there today. But as I will explain below, the majority also gets wrong the most relevant history pertaining to how judicial review of agency interpretations operated in the years before the APA was enacted. I can see one exception whose view was almost completely isolated. But his comments on section 706 refute a different aspect to the majority's argument. Professor John Dickinson, as the majority notes, thought that section 706 precluded courts from deferring to agency interpretations. O nor evidently did the Supreme Court in the years after the APA was enacted. The court never indicated that section 706 rejected the idea the courts might defer to agency interpretations of law. Indeed, not a single justice so much as floated to that view of the APA. The contrary to the court issued a number of decisions to those in those years deferring to an agency's statutory interpretation, and that continued right up until Chevron. To be clear, deference in those years was not always given to interpretations that would receive it under Chevron. The practice then was more inconsistent and less fully elaborated than it later became. The point here is only that the court came nowhere close to accepting the majority's view of the APA. Take the language of section 706 and the majority most relies on decide all relevant questions of law. In the decade after the APA's enactment, those words were used only four times in Supreme Court opinions, all in footnotes, and never to suggest that courts could not defer to agency or interpret ##ations the majority of of seven or six likes wise gets no support from how judicial appro okay, this is all boring. But unlike the majority, he viewed that bar as a change. Comparedinson how much was last 14 pages of this? The thing that kaganals it feels like shes arguing a lot in her opinions is that there are times where courts have deferred to agency interpretation, which is fine. The problem with Chevron is the requirement, and I don't see her addressing that ever. I don't know, 50 pages left. Department general the problem for the majority is that in the years preceding the APA, courts became ever moreerential to agencies. New Deal administrative programs had by that point come into their own, and this court and others in a fairly short time had abandoned their initial resistance, gotten on board. Justice Breyer, wearing his administrative law scholar hat, characterized the pre APA period. In this way, judicial review of administrative actions was curtailed. Particular in particular, agency decisions were frequently sustained with judicial obeisance to the mysteries of administrative expertise. And that description extends to review of an agency statutory constructions. Hmm. Okay. An influential study of administrative practice published five years before the AP's enactment described the state of play. Judicial review may, in some instances at least, be limited to the inquiry. Whether the administrative construction is a permissible one, or again, where the statute is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, the court may accept that of the administrative body. Because the APA was meant to restate the present law. The judicial review practices of the 19 fories are more important to understanding the statute than in any earlier tradition, such as the majority dwells on. But before I expand on those APA contemporaneous practices, I pausede to note that they were not built on sand. Since the early days of the republic, this court has given significant weight to official interpretations of ambiguous law. With the passage of time and the growth of the administrative spherar, those judicial expressions of deference increased. Yeah, but again, like given weight to doesn't mean demanding differencece to the court stateord great weight to an agency construction in the face of statutory uncertainty or ambiguity. Two prominent Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s put those principles into action. Gravers Powell was then widely understood as the leading case on review of agency interpretations. It established the doctrine of gravy Palell. There, the court deferred to an agency construction of the term producer as used in a statutory exemption from price controls. Congress, the court explained, had committed the scope of the exemption to the agency because its experience in the field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable adjustment of the conflicting interests. Accordingly, the court concluded that it was not the province of a court to substitute its judgment for the agencies. Three years later, the court decided some bullshit. Another acknowledged leading case. The court again deferred, this time to an agency's construction of the term imp in the National Labor Relations act. The scope of that term, the court explained, belonged to the agency based on its everyday experience and the administration of the statute. The court therefore limited its review to whether the agency's reading had warrant in the record and reasonable bases in law. Recall here that even the majority accepts that 706 was meant to restate the present laws. Judicial review, blah, blah, blah. Okay, hold on. Let me scan this for anything noteworthy. U there's no way around those two. No way. This first piece o a pluck off in my office, I can give a.\\n\\nC: Ch clock.\\n\\nDestiny: Because time is important. We got story decisis arguments arguing that it's entitled to strong starry decisis protections. Do you plan on reading the bump stock ban opinion? Probably not. We need to. I need to not do too many things like this in a row. I think when my brain gets, like, wired for a particular subject, I just want to like dive really hardcore to that subject. But I think its'bad for there'a lot of viewer fatigue from. Yeah, so, like, doing two supreme court cases in a row is probably not the best and then doing three would be way too many. Pco. I think Pisco gave the strongest argument against Chevron that I'm not seeing in any of k against decision. One of the strongest arguments for getting rid of Chevron is the idea that a new administration can come in and just change a regulation without the statute changing. And Pisco said one of the arguments Peisco gave was, well, what if different lawyers and different circuits or different districts in the different circuits all have different interpretations of a particular statute? Or, I'm sorry, I have a particular regulation as well. So you could get an inconsistent regulatory framework through the courts as well, which is interesting.\\n\\nB: Sorry.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, hold on. Five pages left. Because Congress has passed laws under a chevron two step assumption. Okay. At destiny. Again, from experience, these agencies love ambiguity. They abuse the hell of it. You can call them and beg them and give you definition of law. They won't. They will keep exit te me min. That's fine. Listen, my dude, I don't understand you. Yes, I understand that you'heavily biased against agencies. That's fine. You can. Every single complaint that you're making, you can just as easily construe against judges as well, my friend. Okay, so nothing you're typing is not as that much. Okay. Those were the days when we knew what we are not. Is destiny officially part of the project liberal thing or do they just like quoting him? No, although they did email me, but I said I don't trust anybody in the political world. Now everybody'a schizo. But I see there stu on Twitter looks kind of based. I usually tweet it. Xxx Mina, do you agree 1 billion% that the 2020 election was absolutely fair or at the very least, that there was no outcome determinative voter fraud? Okay, I'm waiting. Um. Okay, wait. We're done with this. Okay, my files. Did that PDF go into where was supposed to. Im assuming I did. Okay, fair know that the judges could have done something. Also know, I believe, like most court cases, there needed to be a thorough investigation first by the FBI, independent prosecutor. Prosecutor. I dont understand. Let me ask again very clearly, very simply, do you think that the judges made the correct decisions in every single Trump case where they said that there was, where they tossed all those cases? Do you think that the judges made the good decisions there? So you would say there was no outcome determinativeative election fraud because we trust that the judges delivered the correct decision there? Yes, the judges did. Okay. Good job. But something happened with PV. I haven't heard much of them or seen them post testing some. No, I don't think so. I think they just, theyre doing their thing. Okay. Am I making a video on Chevron? Probably not. What would even change under Chevron, a lot of regulatory framework is on the idea that executive agencies will have some leeway in interpreting how a regulation should appear if the written statute from Congress is ambiguous, if legal action was ever brought. Challenging a statute? No, challenging a regulation. The court under Chevron's two step analysis was forced to give deference to the agency concerning the legality of the regulation. Now, with Chevron gone, a whole host of federal agencies can be challenged in court over statutory, statutory interpretations of their regulations, potentially leading to a lot of regulatory change. Okay, this would be the relevance, major points of the decision. I just need to write these down. Okay. So Roberts spends the vast majority of his decision. Why is destiny creating notes on Chevron? Is he playing? Because I'm making notes on everything. That's the whole point of this month. Okay. Everything we talk about in doing stream, I need to make notes on. Okay. I need to have notes on things. Okay. This is peak autism. I'm a politics streamer. The autism is you watching people that just scream at tweets all day, kill yourself in a video game. Robertson'bestity of his decision actually wait. True. There you go. What's your opinions on? I don't know. Ask me tomorrow night. Let's we do. I'll do that. With Dan and hopefully XQC arguing that Chevron is a violation of the separation of powers by assuming that any ambiguity and any given legislative statute is necessarily left to interpretation by an executive agency tasked with, tasked with enforcing the given statute, Roberts argues it is unfit, unwise, it is incongruent with the construction of the us government, of the, of our three separate branches for the judiciary to give away matters of legal interpretation necessarily to executive agencies. When Congress has not answered a given, answered has not explicitly how ambiguity, ambiguity should be, should be decided. Gorsuch writes in his opinion, attacking the starry decisis defense of this of Chevron and details the details. The troubled legislative. No, the troubled judicial history in regards to Chevron and how unworkable it was as a doctrine. Major points of the descent O. Kagan, writing for the descent, argues that the APA section 706 does not explicitly grant the courts the ability to. To do what? De novo analysis of any ambiguous, ambiguous congressional statute instead argues that environment, the legal and legislative environment at the time of the APA's passage and leading up to Chevron, pointed to an increase in judicial deference to agency. Agency. Statutory interpretation points out that all legislation that has passed since it'passed under the shadow of Chevron, and that overturning this decision will cause a major regulatory upset, something the court is supposed to av avoid unless dire circumstances call for. Call for it. Okay, good enough. Good. Okay. Do you not believe Chevron gave the legislature way out of having to compromise on bills and instead pass something broad so that it can pass? No, not really. Boom. Boom. When I publish notes, do PDF's not get published and when you sync stuff. No, it wouldn't be sync, it'd be in published. I wonder why is it, does it just not ever do that core plugins publish. They're planning on adding support for PDF s in the future. Oh. Huh. In terms of where would we put if we were going to talk about like core american values, what folder would this go? College speeches, debates, debate reviews, personal stuff n research? Probably not just strategy. I could rename this folder. I feel like it would fit under here. Uh, I don't know. I lean towards. I think it was probably fine to toss the decision after reading the case. Do not think this case will have significant impact on the country. I think right now I think its hard to say. It might not. Did the courting ever get back to you? Nope. Oh, wait, wheres forethought? Did he want to come in here? Would you support codifying che run into law? What's up? Okay. What's up? I just, you know, forthoss trial, there's a nice big cancellation thread. I just want to go over it real quick, if you don't mind. Okay. I'm just gonna send you the original thread. Well, making forethought, tired as a bandw worthy offense. That's the. Yeah, I'm linking the thread where those screenshots came from because I think the context is a little bit important. Okay, so do you want to just read through the whole thing or are you ok with me just summarizing? Hold on. It's not loading. You know what? W load hold Reddit. Okay. Okay. What do you want to do? You want to read any of this or what do you want to do? Yeah, sure. There's just some context I think is important. So my comment was to wick, feel free to move me from my position. The question remains the same. What political maneuver do you see Biden pulling that pulls him out of his nosedive, et cetera, etcetera. And then Taika comes in and says, it's absolutely possible that Biden simply cannot win. I firmly believe literally anyone else can do worse. And it's your burden to prove someone else. Kamal is s, obviously second best. So my response to him is a link to the internal polling of various candidates that have been considered polling ahead of Biden. Do you mind opening up that first link in that six point comment.\\n\\nD: So.\\n\\nDestiny: That polling is part of the response and it just, well, one, do those slides when I respond to that, probably. Really? Wait, what? Do you think it's unreasonable? That was, I thought you said, do you think it's reasonable? I said, sorry. Yeah, I think it's reasonable, but it's not unreasonable. Okay, thank you. Why would you say it's not unreasonable? It's not unreasonable. Okay. It's reasonable. Yes. Correct. Okay.\\n\\nB: Yeahry.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Okay. So I, I link that data, and then he says, the only person you brought up, Michelle Obama, absolutely refus to be president, when obviously, if you just look at the very first link, that's not the only person that's being brought up. They've not been brought up in anything. And at this point, I'm just annoyed because this keeps happening where people, like, ask for a, like, ask for examples. I provide the examples. So at this point, I'm saying, fuck it. Ban this guy for literacy. Because if he just addresses anything, he could say almost anything else. And, like, I don't ban him. If he says, like, I don't think that internal polling is legitimate, that's fine. There are tons of other, other people that thread that I don't ban for obvious reasons, obviously, cont, contingen issue. So I don't expect everyone to agree with me, obviously. But when people, like, ask for evidence, I provide the evidence and they just refuse to engage with it. That, that tilts me a little bit. And I think that's important. Important context. Okay, hold on 1 second. Okay. How many other, who else got banned in that thread? Just that guy, I think. But in the other thread, oh, we swing the hammer. I mean, I guess in retrospect, do you think that thread is like reasonable. You think that paints what? And this one I probably would have been this guy. Yeah. If you link something and he doesnt respond to it and then he x smok in the response, that guy is getting a 700 day ban. Absolutely. This guy would be 100% okay. Its absolutely possible that Biden simply cannot win. If so, thats real tough. I firmly believe that literally anyone else will do worse and its your burd of proof for someone else. Kamala is obviously the second best. I stillvate to hear from anyone who they think is third best other than our care. Jill Stein Newsom will probably be is not that day. And then the first source here is leaked from Biden's campaign for internal polling. One of these slides is showing a host of candidates and then another thing for pulling today. Oh that pulling today is partially, I don't remember exactly why linked it at the time but I think it was related just to like where, how far Biden had fallen in the polls and why. But he doesn't address either of them. So doesn Michelle Obama and Michelle Obamaly pull ten plus points ahead of Trump? This is not saying she'run the point that it's already a replacement. The idea of the bite is the only human o the only person you brought up. Michelle Obama absolutely refuses to be president. So it doesn't matter how well she pulls. It also doesn't matter how poorly Biden pulls at this point because you haven't brought up a candidate to compare against. Sure'be great if generic Democrat would run but that isn't. Okay, ye but the link here doesn't, um, I don't know, I think it's fairfuck it. Yeah, fuck them. Okay, who got ban in the other thread? Oh, in the other, the main thread complaining about this, like, you know, I just, I sw a little swing a little freely, you know, after the mass unb. I think if you can just go back and like double check just to, just to make sure I'm being a fucking retard. You know what? Eat shit. Damn. How u how long were the bands for? 900 days. 900 days. You know, it's as long as I goes. Anything else? Do you want to argue about Biden? No, it's a really. Yeah, I figured. All right. Okay.\\n\\nD: Fun. Peace out.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, fuck him. I don't see the whole threatead for this u. I was being a lazy commenter, banned. Now if you don't engage materially with something being said and you get caught doing that, yeah, you get ban. Fuck that shit. I'n to waste post on it. Wait, what is this? Oh, no. 1 hour ago. No, it didn't happen. Did I talk to the one weed guy yesterday or the day before? Thed community guy was two days ago, right? No way did this happen within two days. It's not going to be what I think it is. It's not going to be this.\\n\\nB: I saw Destiny s debate against Finkelstein.\\n\\nDestiny: It.\\n\\nB: But I thought that it would take us down a path of antagonism. His Finkelstein debate was a rout. The way that on top of it, Norm Finkelstein never said his name correctly. He called him Mister Borelli like four times. But I thought that, like, bringing up that conversation would have been antagonistic in a way that may have created enmity that wasn't there and we wouldn't have gotten to talk, right, like. But yeah, the Finkelste. I'watched the Finkelstein conversation and Norm Finkelstein fucking sauced on him. I saw Destiny's debating Algh.\\n\\nDestiny: That's the end. I've tried. I did the quiz thing against him and it felt really awkward, but I did it anyway. But then I let him sa face to the end. I have no more goodwill. From now on, there will be no bridge building at the end of a conversation like that. I will only accept complete and total submission. No one will walk away with any amount of grace without doing that first. That's it. I'm done. I'm out. No more.\\n\\nB: I thought that it would take us down a path of antagonism that Norm Finkelstein never said his name correctly. He called him, like, the Finkelste. I'watched the Finkelstein conversation and Norm Finkelstein fucking sauced on him. It was horrifying.\\n\\nDestiny: Stop being cringe on everything you talk to. Hisardis his pothead. Ah, it kind of seems like it. I ratcheted up the temperature last time. Okay. More than I normally would. We're just gonna keep going up. We're gonna keep going hotter and hotter. Okay.\\n\\nB: See the wrist drip?\\n\\nDestiny: There you go.\\n\\nB: Stern glass Hamburg chrono. Pretty wearable watch. And it's a mecha quartz, so I don't have to wind it. I think I'm gonna be, like, going forward being way less selective about getting quartz watches. You know, when. When I first started getting into watches, I was on mechanical watches only. Really? And now that I own two quartz watches, well, I own one quartz swatch and one digital. I love them all. So.\\n\\nDestiny: Actually, you know what? Oh, hey, I had some questions about a thing you brought up having to do with how communities perceive each other on the Internet, even if the commentators seem to be an alignment on a lot of other issues. Do you have any time today to chat about it? I'm streaming for another 5 hours. Smiley face.\\n\\nB: I'probably going to end up getting. Probably going to end up.\\n\\nDestiny: Hammarded. Do you think it'reasonable to think the overturning of branch? I think reasonable minds can disagree on how the courts should interact with these things. That's all I gott. Sayeah. He's getting on. I see. He can shoot me a message or hop into a discord channel.\\n\\nB: Heybody.\\n\\nDestiny: Hi. What's up?\\n\\nB: People in chat said that you wanted to talk to me.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Okay. I'm curious. All right.\\n\\nB: Mmm.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. So one of things I do on the Internet is obviously a lot of debating stuff, among other things. And there'a lot of different perceptions to debates that I have. Obviously different communities perceive debates in different ways. Right.\\n\\nB: I kind of brought that up to you when we talked.\\n\\nD: Right.\\n\\nB: That my community and your community are at odds, but I don't feel that enmity towards you personally, even though we disagree on some things.\\n\\nDestiny: Mm hmm.\\n\\nB: Right.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nB: And that's that. I feel that same thing kind of comes from yours. Ye, like, your community is pretty fucking harsh to me. But you weren't, you know, like, at least I don't feel like you were. Maybe you were being like covertly harsh in your destiny way, but like, honestly, I didn't feel salty about our discussion and I didn't post any salt about it either.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, sure. I'm usually, if I'm salty, I'm usually.\\n\\nB: Okay, well, me too. Fair enough. They call me salty Paul. So.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so what?\\n\\nB: So what? Like, I only. I have a show that starts at 02:00 p.m. yeah, you're good.\\n\\nDestiny: Good. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.\\n\\nB: So let's get to it.\\n\\nDestiny: I had a huge debate with Benny Morris on my side, and on the other side was Muen Rabani and Norm Finkelstein. And I've noticed that there's a lot of different perceptions of that debate on the Internet. Wildly different depending upon apparently which side you're on while watching it. I'm curious, did you, have you seen this debate or do you have any idea?\\n\\nB: I did. I will not claim to have watched the whole thing, but I didn't clip chimp it either. I just didn't get through the entire thing. But I watched, I think, about 20 minutes of you going back and forth. It might have been a highlight, but it was a long highlight, maybe from your channel, I don't know. But yeah, no, I didn't watch the whole debate. Okay. As well.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, I'm curious, what were your perceptions of that debate?\\n\\nB: Okay, so Norm Finkelstein is a guy that I like because I, you know, like he. I like that he gets passionate and, you know, I think that these days you. You yell, you lose is kind of like the way that it works, especially in these kind of, like, debate spaces. And I appreciate when people are willing to do that. And so I like Norm Finkelstein's personality for that. As far as that debate, I don't know if Norm Finkelstein is the most, like, effective advocate for palestinian liberation or against israeli aggression against Palestine. In the same way, I'm probably not the most effective advocate for the things that I lay out. Right. I'm a little bit off pudding. People call me smug, acerbic, all that shit. Right. So I think that that's how I feel about Finkelstein. I think the funniest part of that debate was when he kept calling you Mister Borelli and you didn't correct him. I don't know why.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Are you aware that he was intentionally mispronouncing my name and that he knew my name the whole time?\\n\\nB: Do you think that's what was going on?\\n\\nDestiny: Yes.\\n\\nB: Okay. Do you have any proof of that?\\n\\nDestiny: Yes. So in the debate, one of the things that Lex left in was as soon as we were on break and we stood up to do something, either I was talking to him or he was talking to me, but he used my name precisely correctly. And me and Benny and Lex all laughed because, like, you do know my name. Also, he gave multiple interviews after that debate, one with Breiana joy Gry. And he said that his.\\n\\nB: Maybe he was Corre. Maybe.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. He gave an interview after where he talked to Brianna Dry Gray and he said that his goal for going into that debate was to just turn it into a clown show the entire time.\\n\\nB: Fair enough. Did he actually say that or what were his words? Because that sounds like a destiny paraphrase. Right? Like what? What did he actually say about his intentions to Briana Jo Gray? If you just shoot me a transcript or something, I'll read it myself. You ain't got aa, you know.\\n\\nDestiny: Yep. Hold on.\\n\\nB: I don't think you guys can. Oh, man. Fuck. Well, hold up. Let me just do this real quick. I was streaming and I didn't even fucking start my. So people have just been listening to me the whole time.\\n\\nDestiny: On min, I sent you a YouTube video where he talks about it in the beginning. Okay.\\n\\nB: You dm me on Twitter?\\n\\nDestiny: Yep.\\n\\nB: Okay, give me one sec. How you feel about Kanye's new kind of stuff? I know you're like, used to be a big Kanye apologist. I was just having an argument on my stream about Kanye when you pulled me in.\\n\\nDestiny: What? I used to be a Kanye apologist.\\n\\nB: Not apologist, like politically. I'm talking music wise. You were a Kanye fan for a long time. I remember back in the day you used to play a lot of.\\n\\nDestiny: Of course, yeah. I love Kanye s old stuff.\\n\\nB: Do you like the newer stuff or you kind of like.\\n\\nDestiny: No, I don't, but. Okay.\\n\\nC: Okay.\\n\\nB: Sorry, my bad. I'm just getting into the fucking thing.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm going to listen to this. I'm two times it. I think it's all like, in the first three minutes, I'm just listening and I'll grab some quotes. Hold on.\\n\\nB: Fair enough.\\n\\nG: Of your obvious contempt for the lack of intellectual rigor that destiny brought to the debate, but also substantively, you know, both you and Wayie, so thorough and persuasive, and you each brought different things to the debate, different kind of attitudes that had effect, working, I think, in tandem to address the claims that were coming from the other side of the table. Kind of different tonal modes that I think played well with each other. Kind of a good cop bad cop, if you will. And it was so satisfying and so informative. And you say, okay, it doesn't have as much reach as going on mainstream news, or you haven't been invited on mainream channels in the US, but there are millions of views on that video.\\n\\nDestiny: Please.\\n\\nG: It'S a great thing. There are millions of views on that video. There'millions of views on our interviews with, like, Jordan Peton's daughter and Candace Owens. And remember that CNN only gets, what, like 500,000 views on a primeime airing.\\n\\nD: I have to tell youine who I love to dance. I've known him for 30 years. We met in the early 1980s. We had a fundamental clash over what.\\n\\nDestiny: You call tonal mode.\\n\\nD: Said, I am going to speak not to them, but to the broader audience and enlighten them and the facts.\\n\\nDestiny: Maybe you're going to do the but.\\n\\nD: I am taking my swedhammer to the porcelain bank. I am going to imagine this.\\n\\nDestiny: Every.\\n\\nD: Time moine got into a serious mode as the answer called destiny.\\n\\nB: Okay, so he's taking a sledgehammer to the porcelain. He'snn smash you smithereens that's not the same as. I want it to be a clown.\\n\\nDestiny: Keep listening, keep listening, keep listening.\\n\\nB: Okay, okay. Sorry. I paused. I'm at about 228.\\n\\nDestiny: Yep. Here, wait, wait. You're at 228? I'm gonna put it at.\\n\\nB: I'm at 228 and I'm at two x.\\n\\nDestiny: Cool. Okay. 228. Two x. Put it to 1.5 x. Okay. And then we'll go at the same time.\\n\\nB: Give me. Give me a sec here. 1.5. I've just started being able to do this fucking two x shit. Okay. Yeah, I'm ready. Three, two, one, play.\\n\\nDestiny: So every time marine got into a.\\n\\nD: Serious mode as the answer thing called destiny.\\n\\nDestiny: What the are you doing? You are this of shit. That is not going to happen on my watch.\\n\\nD: Every of my pred.\\n\\nDestiny: So, you moron. I think. Do you know what it means? Bring.\\n\\nD: I prefer bey Hon. What it means when you spent 42.\\n\\nDestiny: Years reading every scrap, every footnote. Ok, pause.\\n\\nB: Okay, so I don't see this as materially much different than, like, you going on a show, right, and saucing on somebody pretty hard in a debate.\\n\\nDestiny: Can you give me an example of me being invited to a serious.\\n\\nB: Post thing? This, like, after party where they're clearly just reveling in what was seen as an optic win for Finkelstein?\\n\\nDestiny: Well, so. Well, here's my. Well, okay, here. One.\\n\\nB: It's cringe.\\n\\nDestiny: It's not about it.\\n\\nB: You've done.\\n\\nDestiny: Go ahead real quick. Can you. I'm linking you. This. This is just like. You just watch like 20 seconds of this real quick. Okay.\\n\\nB: Yeah, give me a sec.\\n\\nDestiny: There's a reason why genocide. To condemn every.\\n\\nB: This is time. This is time. What? This was a timestamp link, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Yep. It's a timestamp link. Just watch it. I .5 or, you know, watch it at one time speed. Okay. I think it's just like 30 seconds. Yeah. This is when we go on break for a sec. I think there's a reason why genocide is so such an importantly guarded concept. And it's not to condemn every nation that goes to war. You know howoun you into italian all the time by your. Yeah. Yeah. So this is when he thinks we're off camera. The break has started in.\\n\\nB: Yeah. Like I said, I hadn't watched the whole thing. I probably didn't get to this point, but.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, o.\\n\\nB: That's cool. Okay. But can I ask you a question?\\n\\nDestiny: Nope, not yet.\\n\\nB: That.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, wait. Not yet. Backing up. You agree he was mispronouncing my name? If we look at what he said to Brianna, we look at what happened on break, and then you compare the fact that he saw my name ten different ways. We agree that he was mispronouncing my name intentionally. That was like a meme for him, right?\\n\\nB: Probably, yeah, it seems that way. Given the context you've given me. I don't see why that didn't say.\\n\\nDestiny: How to change everything. But he was misones name. You also agree. Wait, wait, real quick. You also agree we're not talking about making memes real quick, are you?\\n\\nB: Why am I being interrogated about your Finkelstein appearance?\\n\\nDestiny: You're not. I just want to make sure that we have, like, a same factual understanding of whated. Okay. You also agree that he said to Brianna that if Moen was gonna have a serious conversation, like, it was frustrating me every time and I was gonna interject and I would say, wow, are you even talking to, like, that said, blah, blah, blah. We agree that he said that to Bronna at least, right?\\n\\nB: Yes. Okay, so can I give you. Can I give you an example? So I'm not sure you maybe aware that I had a run in with Milo Le Yiannopoulos that ended up being used against him six months later and got him banned from C PAAC.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nB: I was the guy that asked the question, do you support cross generational relationships between teen boys and older men? And he went on a drunken ramble. Right?\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, I didn't know that was you on that show. I've watched that show before. I watched him do that.\\n\\nB: Yeah, that was me. That was me that asked him that question. Right o. If you go back and watch that actual show, I was what I would call at that time an agitator. Right? So the guys had warned me. I was fairly new to the drunken peasants at that time. And the guys had warned me, like, hey, this guy Milo that we're having on tonight, he's not a fuck around guy. He's a big name, and you need to treat him as such. But in the past, they'd had me on to be a. Like a fistful of sand, like a coarseness, right? Where people would be cordial.\\n\\nDestiny: Oay.\\n\\nB: I was supposed to take it to a different level and not have it be cordial. And that is how I got Milo so mad that he was willing to say the thing that ended his career. And now he is a chiclet toothed ex christian grifter because of me. Okay, right? So somebody being an agitator in a conversation isn't necessarily just all negative all the time.\\n\\nDestiny: It doesn't necessarily. But do you agree that there are times. Sure. Do you agree there are times when. Understand. No, I, what you said, do you agree that there are times when being an agitator is probably inappropriate?\\n\\nB: Yes.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nB: Yes.\\n\\nDestiny: So if you get invited, if you get invited.\\n\\nB: This case, and in this case when, when I said earlier that I believe that norm Finkelstein might not be the best front facing advocate for palestinian liberation or palesinian statehood or an end to the war in Gaza. Right. He might not be the best. And that's the reason I said it, because I think he's abrasive, I think he's aerbic and I think he's prone to doing things exactly like he did to you.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. So if this guy is not the best advocate and he's an agitator despite what he, and if this is supposed to be an invite to aious five and a half hour conversation about an incredibly important issue that's affecting, you know, worldwide opinion about a lot of things right now or at that time, do you think it was inappropriate for him to accept that debate invitation that he should have said, this is probably not like for me. I probably don't want to, I don't think I should be involved in this. Do you think that was inappropriate for him to accept that?\\n\\nB: I mean, were you being an agitator and kind of absurbic when smug leftist gets double dunked on my show or whatever?\\n\\nDestiny: Well, one, I didn't name it. My YouTube guy did, but I'll take respons for itwling. That's fine.\\n\\nB: But conversation about important things though, right?\\n\\nDestiny: No, it was like we're having, it was t, no, we're having a casual conversation on a stream right now. This is a casual conversation on a stream right now. Okay.\\n\\nB: It was a sprawling casual conversation about 90 different topics that we had over five fucking hours.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, but this wasn't like a formal debate where people were being flown to location to film a long debate with pre like historians on a topic over.\\n\\nB: An incrediblen't make it, does that make it less important that people hear the truth?\\n\\nDestiny: It makes the, does that make you less. You were, excuse me. Hold on. Let me finish. It makes the, the appropriateness of the behavior a lot different. If somebody's invited to like a casual stream, to like chat and chill with somebody, I expect swear words. I expect raunchy. If somebody's invited to a college to debate in front of students or to a formal sit down event or to a studio somewhere, the standard of behavior is going to be wildly different in these settings. Right?\\n\\nB: I agree. I agree.\\n\\nDestiny: You're not recentering. Do you think that it was inappropriate for Finkelstein to accept the invite for that debate, that he should have said, I'm sorry, I don't think I have the demeanor or the disposition to do this conversation. So I'm going to pass on this, and I'm going to allow this incredibly important topic in a formal manner to be discussed by somebody that's more equipped to have the conversation.\\n\\nB: Did Finkelstein organize the debate?\\n\\nDestiny: Nobo. But he accepted the invite.\\n\\nB: Who invited him?\\n\\nDestiny: Lex Friedman.\\n\\nB: Did Lex Friedman know Norm Finkelstein's past?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't think Norm has ever had that type of behavior before.\\n\\nB: Okay, so you're saying that him kind of, like, agitating against you was different than when he yells and screams at everybody else?\\n\\nDestiny: I have never seen him. Can you name a single other, like, tv interview, anything where he acts like this, ever?\\n\\nB: Where he acts like this. I mean.\\n\\nDestiny: No. Where he acts even close to this ever.\\n\\nB: I don't like. Like I said, dude, I'm. I don't know why I've been pulled in to be the norm Finkelstein advocate here. We don't have know.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, wait. Hold on. You only be made it because you're chooing. Well, you. Because you could just say, no, I.\\n\\nB: Didn'T choose to come in here. You asked me to come in here. And this Finkelstein thing, I don't know why it's on your mind with regards to me.\\n\\nDestiny: So you asked me matter what I asked Fin. So you asked me before yesterday, you said, why do people have such different opinions of each other on the Internet? This is one of those reasons. Because anytime you try to get close to figuring out why people do, they get uncomfortable and they don't want to explore it at all. Right?\\n\\nC: Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: So you had a very strong opinion about my conversation with Finkelstein. And that's interesting to me, because when I think back to my conversation with.\\n\\nB: When did we talk about Finkelstein?\\n\\nDestiny: No, yesterday. Nop.\\n\\nB: When did I have a strong opinion about, like, last night when I was streaming. Somebody sent you a clip or something?\\n\\nDestiny: Yep.\\n\\nB: Dude. All right. My chat was asking me all these fucking questions, right? You can watch it. I do nothing but talk to Chad on those fucking streams where I'm outside smoking.\\n\\nDestiny: But if you have this opinion, it's probably possible that a lot of people have this opinion, right?\\n\\nB: I thought it was a funny interview.\\n\\nDestiny: No, you didn't think it was a funny interview, you thought that heauuced me. You seemed like.\\n\\nB: In your debate prep.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure.\\n\\nB: And I thought it made you off balance and uncomfortable, and I thought it made him look better in the debate.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. For the 20 minutes clip that you watched. Of the five and a half hour conversation. Right.\\n\\nB: For the 20 minutes clip of the five and a half hour conversation that I watched.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nB: And my opinion was that he saced on you pretty good.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. And so just like the opinions of.\\n\\nB: A lot of your fans on the clip that you posted of me saying I've read all theory and you asking me if I've read this and that they think that makes me a fucking retard. Right.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but there's a difference, right? One is on substance. Yes. One is on substance, and the other is just like somebody calling somebody names, like your second grade. Right. So, okay.\\n\\nB: Did I do that to you yesterday?\\n\\nDestiny: No, Finkelstein did that to me.\\n\\nB: Okay. I'm sorry for that, bro.\\n\\nDestiny: No, you don't have to apologize. I don't care about the apology.\\n\\nB: Well, you've asked me in here to, like, talk about this Finkelein thing I hold.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm curious why people come to the conclusions they do about a particular thing. In my opinion, any fair watching of that conversation would mean that Finkelstein would look like a joke, like a child.\\n\\nB: Does the story I tell you about how I acted as an agitator against Milo Yiannopoulos and it got him to reveal his position a little more candidly, and that ended up ruining his career. Does that give you an idea of why I might value a figure like Finkelstein as an agitator and you might not.\\n\\nDestiny: If you want to do that, that's fine. But I would argue, will, that's fine. But the problem is that you're lying to yourself and your audience and me when you say that, because I don't think that you view Finle as just being an agitator, and doesn t me. Now hold mind me. Now, if you had to categorize Finkelstein as a binary one or the other, would you categorize Finkelstein as a preeminent israeli palestinian historian who spent the better part of the last 40 years studying the topic, or would you qualify him as just an Internet agitator that tries to make people really mad so they say dumb things?\\n\\nB: I would say he's, he's a little bit more than both of those things, right?\\n\\nDestiny: I think if you had this, if you had to classify him, you're working in a binary class, one of in.\\n\\nG: My mouth and they say, and you.\\n\\nDestiny: Have to do one or the other.\\n\\nB: I would say he's an agitator more than a scholar on Israel, probably. From what I know about him, you're.\\n\\nDestiny: Aware that the vast don't see him that way. You're aware that he doesn't see himself that way.\\n\\nB: Okay, fair. I see him that way. So.\\n\\nDestiny: On that, wait, you're think, cut for a second. What?\\n\\nB: I'm sorry.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nB: So we cool on that then? Because I do see it that way. You've asked me how I see him and I've told you. Is that okay?\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. So if, if, just to clarify, so for future conversations where you're watching debates or whatever, or you're watching people, if you ever see two people arguing with each other over any issue ever, if one guy just starts like calling the other dude names and screaming at him, you're alwaysnna say like, man, that guy did really, really, really good. That was like an epic fucking performance. You would say that you think in all circumstances, irrespective of the political sides being represented.\\n\\nB: No, I would definitely be like, as a viewer of the content, I would be biased towards the person whose opinion I think is correct. Right. If I'm watching it, because like I said, I watched a 20 minutes clip of it, so clearly I was like bored, needed some entertainment. Here's a guy I like, destiny, and another guy that I've liked in the past, finkelstein, going at it. Let me check out a big chunk of this conversation.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, not a big chunk to be clear, a very small chunk.\\n\\nB: Okay, fair enough. It was 5 hours and I watched 20 minutes of it. Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: Yep.\\n\\nB: And that, and then that's just like how the Internet is, right? The Internet will take a big long thing and truncate, you know, certain, at a certain level, it's clip chimping. But I think 30 or 20 minutes worth of a fucking conversation is like at least a decent chunk that you can analyze.\\n\\nDestiny: I would agree. But your, your analysis is literally just, I think that this is epic because this guy like screamd names in the whole time. If you would have watched that debate and it was just, that is essentially what you've said. If you were to watch the debate and I were to just be screamg at Finlyene the whole time like, col, you old man, you stupid fuck. Like you shit yourself. It smells horrible in here. Would you have watched that? And you think, would you have given the opinion like, man, destiny got this guy good. Holy shit, he roasted this dude. Is that what you have come away thinking.\\n\\nB: I mean, that was pretty weak sa shit that you just threw, so probably not.\\n\\nDestiny: No.\\n\\nB: If you said you got poopy in your pants like a, like a fifth grader or something.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, but him, but him calling me a different name like 20 times, come.\\n\\nB: On, he just trolled you with your name a little bit, bro.\\n\\nDestiny: It's notit.\\n\\nB: Deal. To be clear, for Borelli, he just did the Mister Borelli meme.\\n\\nDestiny: I don't know why you keep saying I've done shit like that. I'll challenge you again. Can you think of a serious conversation where I've ever behaved like this, ever? You can't, because I've never done shit like this.\\n\\nB: You talked to Milo Yopolis about. You wouldn't know about fucking little kids, wouldn't you? Yeah, that was a. That was a fucking. That was a. That was a debate on the stage in front of an audience that I assume you were invited to.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes. Correct. Did you watch that?\\n\\nB: I'yes.\\n\\nDestiny: Ok. Watch that. So in that debate.\\n\\nB: Very well. And you did.\\n\\nE: Super.\\n\\nDestiny: I don't need you to complimet on it. I don't need. Don't trust me though. In that debate, I was incredibly formal. I was incredibly polite. The only time I said that about Milo is after he started making personal attacks on me.\\n\\nB: But what? Do you regret making that?\\n\\nDestiny: No, because he decided he wanted to go there. So after he did, it was like, okay, fine, then we'll do that. Okay, but I would never open like that on a platform. I never treat a platform like that. Unless the other person is like decided that that's where they want.\\n\\nB: Is it different if Stayain opened by saying Mister Boreli?\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, that's. No, that wasn't the very first thing he said, but he spent the entirety of the debate not engaging substantively with anything that me or Benny were saying. And just like calling me names and being incredulous the whole time. That was his behavior for five and a half hours? Yes.\\n\\nB: So do, do you think it's a, when we're talking about these kind of contentious issues and stuff, I'd like to pick your brain. Do you think it's a. You think it's a valid tactic to be an agitator and kind of. Kind of get people to expose a little bit more of their position by maybe making them mad, getting under their skin, kind of pushing them a little bit in a way that maybe they're not comfortable with.\\n\\nDestiny: My level one answer would be, it depends on the platform. So there are places where it's appropriate and there are places where it's inappropriate. My higher level answer, if you want to engage with it in a better way, is I think that combining those types of, we'll call them rhetorical flourishes, can be effective, but only if they're paired with substantive critique.\\n\\nB: Okay, so I don't know how much substantive critique was in the Milo episode for me. I basically just provided a leftist counterpoint to his right wing talking points. And I did so in an acerbic and smug way to counter his acerbic smugness. But I don't know that I made a great argument for leftism and that.\\n\\nDestiny: You didn't make a great argument for leftism, but the reason why it destroyed him was because maybe you're just not even aware of it. But when you asked him that on whether or not he thinks, like, little boys should be fucking older men if they're gay, that question, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that question that you asked was a substantive question, even if it was done in an agitator like way. And the answer that he gave was substantive, and that's why it destrayed. It wasn't just because you were being an agitator, because you asked him make question with substance while agitating, that caused him to respond in a way. Sure.\\n\\nB: Do you think that Norman Finkelstein, over the course of that five hour conversation, asked you a substantive question?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't think he had a good substantive disagreement with either of us at a single point that entire five and a half hour conversation.\\n\\nB: Here's what I'll do, Stepven. I will watch the whole five hour conversation and then we can come back to this if you want, and I'll tell you how I feel about it in toto, okay?\\n\\nDestiny: I will be. I will be shocked if you can find a single point of contention that Finkelstein raises with. Of substance, where it's not just him screaming at me, calling me a name, making fun of me, whatever.\\n\\nB: I'm having some. I'm having. You're kind of like slideshow lagging for me. Can I pop in and out again real quick? You want to drag me out and then drag me back in? That might fix it.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. Hold on.\\n\\nB: Thanks. Okay. That usually fucking resets it. I'm sorry. Since I've got you here and I've yesterday, just real quick. And you don't have to respond to the whole thing now, but I thought it was interesting. Somebody kind of like, I'm not gonna claim that I knew this at the time that I brought it up, but I thought it was interesting given you remember we were talking about saudi arabian complicity in 911. M all right, this is a really recent article. I don't know how you feel about the Atlantic, but, you know, I'll read it for your audience so they don't have to try. And for more than two decades, through two wars of domestic upheaval, the idea that al Qaeda acted alone on 911 has been the basis of us policy. A blue ribbon commission concluded that Osama bin Laden had pioneered a new kind of terrorist group, combining superior technological know how, extensive resources, and a worldwide network. Blah, blah, blah. Okay, the assessment now appears wrong, and.\\n\\nC: The.\\n\\nB: The costly policies that the United States has pursued in the past quarter century have been roote in a false premise. A new filing in a lawsuit brought by the families of 911 victims against the government of Saudi Arabia alleges that al Qaeda had significant, indeed decisive, state support for its attacks. Officials of the saudi government, the plaintiff'attorneys contend, formed and operated a network inside the United States that provided crucial assistance to the first cohort, cohort of 911 hijackers to enter the country. Let me get a fucking. What's the fucking memely link to get past the fucking paywall thing. I'm paywallually, I was link. I was linked to this from another source.\\n\\nDestiny: Go. I'll link you, but. Oh, set your link in Twitter.\\n\\nB: Thank you. I just see the one I sent you. Oh, wait.\\n\\nC: Hello.\\n\\nB: Yeah, I don't, I don't have it. Sorry.\\n\\nDestiny: No, on Twitter. Oh, wait. Message failed to sen. Try again.\\n\\nB: Sorry.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. I said no.\\n\\nB: Okay, yeah, there it is.\\n\\nDestiny: Thank you.\\n\\nB: I'll keep going once this archive PH opens. All right, all right. 71 page document released in redacted form earlier this month summarize what the plaintiffs say they've learned through the evidence obtained in discovery and recently declassified materials. They allege that saudi officials, most notably Fahad Alumeri, an imam at Los Angeles mosque and an accredited diplomat at Saudi Arabia's consulate in that city, and Omar al Bayumi, who masqueraded as a graduate student but was identified as the FBI as an intelligence operative, were not rogue operators, but rather the front end of a conspiracy that included the saudi embassy in Washington and senior government officials in Riyadh. The plaintiffs argue that ther and Bayumi organized safe reception, transportation, and housing for hijackers Khalid al Mhar and Haosmi beginning on their arrival in California on January 15, 2000. The filing further argues that thery and Bayumi introduced the pair of to local sympathizers in Los Angeles and San Diego who catered to their day to day needs, including help with immigration matters, digital and phone communications, and receiving funds from al Qaeda by wire transfer. Saudi officials also helped the two al Qaeda operatives, both saudi nationals with little education or command of English, whose experience abroad consisted mostly of training and fighting for jihadist causes, to procure a car as well as driver licenses. The support network was crucial. And it goes on. So, you know, once again, like, this isn't the first news story that's come out about possible saudi complicity in 911, or at least the very least some level of the saudi governmental structure, knowing the funding and helping to fund terrorist actions in America. Right, okay, well, you said that, that there was no evidence for that. That there was. No.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm not aware of any strong evidence for that. Correct.\\n\\nB: I just. Right, and I just gave you a whole fucking paragraph of how saudi officials helped two of the hijackers procure a car and juice in with local officials so that they could get their needs met by people that were sympathetic to their cause.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you think that a whole paragraph is going to make me dramatically reform my opinion on this particular topic?\\n\\nB: I was just wondering. No, I was just wondering what you thought in the same way that I. You didn't think you were going toa make me think differently about Finkelstein by dragging me in here right before my show. I don't think that I'm go goingna change your mind, but I'm wondering if it makes you, if you think that this is interesting, given your, your two days ago complete and utter incred, incredulity at there being any saudi complicity in 911.\\n\\nDestiny: So let me just back up for 1 second and explain a difference in like, epistemic frameworks here. Okay. I gather information, and then once I gather that information, I tried to put together a certain view of the world, and then I have that view of the world. See if it's congruent with new information that I gather. If it is, then it reinforces my view of the world. If it's not, then I change my view accordingly. Okay. It feels like you have a certain view of the world that you really want to make work, and then you find information that fits into it. And then if it does, that's good. And if it doesn't, then we discard it. That's, it feels like. So yesterday. Hold on, wait. So yesterday. Wait. So yesterday, okay, when you were talking about how Saudi Arabia, for my understanding of how Saudi Arabia has functioned and what their goals are as a state. And the information has been released about Saudi Arabia working with hijackers. My understanding is that there was no state directed coordination. Okay. The state officials, when you, those two things aren't the same thing. They don't mean the same thing. But when you link me an article, okay, and you say, what about this? Well, a paragraph or two.\\n\\nB: I didn't say, what about this?\\n\\nDestiny: I said, he said what? When you linked me this. Okay, so there's two things. One, I haven't read this full article, so I don't even know what's all in this article. Okay? But two, you also haven't read this full article, so I don't know why you're citing. This is something to further support your position. It reinforces in my mind that your epistemicp foundation.\\n\\nB: Wa wa waitit? What do you mean I haven't read this whole article?\\n\\nDestiny: You haven't read the entire article, but your citing.\\n\\nB: I read the entire article. When it was linked to me. It had an archive link when it was linked to me and I went and found it, and I didn't have.\\n\\nDestiny: The archive l. If it was linked to and you read it on the archive link, why would you have a link to the original?\\n\\nB: My phone. I read it on my phone.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh. Can you tell me a little bit about what's in the article then?\\n\\nB: The article is about families of 911 people that were killed in 911, suing the saudi government because new information was released that shows complicity of saudi officials with 911 hijackers.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about, like, what kind of information is alleged in this article?\\n\\nB: The reason I read you the beginning of the article, because is felt like it would be better to summarize in that way than to give you my summary.\\n\\nDestiny: Why would it?\\n\\nB: The name of Hamid al Bami.\\n\\nDestiny: You don't have to give me the names, but like, what? Typ? Yeah.\\n\\nB: An emam in Las.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, hold on. If you've read an article and you're giving me information on, I don't know why you would be defensive or upset when I'm asking you to summarize the aud. You're being defensive and upset right now. I'm just asking you to summarize. Can you tell me about what this. Okay, so all I'm asking is, is because I'm seeing here that this says's a 27 minutes. Listen, so it seems like a fairly long ish article. It's gonna take at least probably five to ten minutes to read okay, so I'm just curious, can you summarize, rather than give me the first two paragraphs, can you just summarize, like, what is the article? What new pieces of information were brought up? What's something in here? They'll be like, oh, shit. I should consider that the new pieces.\\n\\nB: Of information that are highlighted in most of the article are the imam in Los Angeles and another saudi adjunct official from the embassy who helped gather intelligence and materially support two of the hijackers from 911. They provided them with the ability, like translators, the ability to get a car when they could not speak English. They facilitated their living situation and subsidized their living. Right. Subsidized their food and shelter and worked with in order to get that done.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, hold on. All right. So now, I think, assuming you're not reading now, it sounds to me like you have read that article, that summary that you just gave me there was better, even if it wasn't in the tele, it was better than just reading the first couple paragraphs.\\n\\nB: Ok, fair enough then.\\n\\nDestiny: Ok. Yeah.\\n\\nB: Ok, fair enough.\\n\\nDestiny: Cool. Okay. So if you ask me, would this change your mind about this given thing? So my process would be, is I would have to read the article first. Okay. And then, first I would have to see, on its face is anything that's alleged in this article, contrary to any of my understandings of how this works. So, for instance, let's say I do read the whole article, and the article just says some saudi nationals helped other saudi nationals, right? Let's say that I read it and said that. I'm like, okay, well, it might be good information. This isn't like government officials. I didn't say. I'm saying hypothetically, if it did say that, okay, if that was the case, then I was, okay, well, this doesn't need, I don't need to reconstitute some historical understanding I have of Saudi Arabia or 911 or I think more or less it. Maybe I can read it to figure it out. Right? But let's say that I read this, and let's say that it alleges that we'go to the other end. Let's say that it alleges that saudi officials, taking direction from the government, were providing material assistance to people that they knew were associated with the terrorist organization that was planning on attacking the United States of. Okay, that would be a significant claim, and it would challenge some of my preconceptions or conceptions that I'd formed about how Saudi Arabia operated in the early two thousands. So then after reading the article, the next step would be I would ask, well, what are the compelling pieces of information brought up in this article about this? And how does Saudi Arabia respond to them? Okay, so then I would probably look at what they're sourcing, and then I would, if I really want, I would dive into the underlying documents and then I would read, let's say, oh, interesting. It seems like the saudi arabian government was at the very least aware that people close to the government with financial resources were making them available to terrorist to attack the United States. Then I would probably reconstitute that part of my historical understanding of the relation between Saudi Arab and America. Like, okay, wow, it seems like Saudi Arabia was involved materially in helping the hijackers in 911. That's really fucked up. And it should say something about our relationship with Saudi Arabia or their relationship with us. Yes, that's how will work. Yes.\\n\\nB: Okay, fair enough. Yeah. I wasn't asking you, by the way, to flash change your mind because I threw an article link at you. I was just wondering, like, I want. I don't know how. How would I properly ask in the future? What do you think about, like, if I should I just say this? What do you think about this?\\n\\nDestiny: Given our conversation, given that I just spent the past week on stream reading two Supreme Court decisions from first to last page, if you want me to have an opinion about a thing, generally, you just need to throw it at me so that I can, like, go through it all and read it, and then after that I would give an opinion. Yeah.\\n\\nB: You and I haven't had, like, a long correspondence. I don't know how you work, bro.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, that's. Yeah, that's. I just told you. Hold on to get defensive. I'm not attacking. I'm just saying that this is my. What I read a lot of, dude.\\n\\nB: People always say that I just have a way of speaking that I think people take a certain way. I'm very direct, and I have a tone to my voice that comes off to people. Dude, I'm not. I wasn't.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, maybe you should work on that.\\n\\nB: Well, I mean, I've been doing my job for ten years. I've been making money doing nothing but podcasting exclusively for ten years. I'm doing. Okay. Like, I make money.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm not saying I have no claim to your job. I've been doing my job for a long time as well. And there are parts where my job carries over into my real life in really negative ways that I've had to change. Right. So when I talk, for instance, ##ay I talk like that to everybody in my personal life. Such that when a girlfriend asks me if we're cuddling on the couch, and she's like, oh, this is so nice. Do you think we'll be together forever? My answer is, I mean, I would hope that we'd be together forever, but I can't give you, like, a 100% assurance of that. I mean, maybe I give you odds that we were to about right. Because in my mind, like, I'm hedging every single statement I'm ever making. Because I know that any part can be clipped and used against me feet. Right. So that would be an example to where there are some behaviors that I need to modify in real life. And when I converse with other people, because I carry them over my work. And it's probably. That's what I'm saying.\\n\\nB: And we have very different, like, goals. Right. You have a very deep investment and not being made to look bad, and I don't care.\\n\\nDestiny: Hold on, wait. Nope. I don't have a very deep investment and not being made to look bad. I don't care if I look bad. I have a very deep investment and not being misrepresented. That's my fair.\\n\\nB: Yes, I hate being misrepresented, too. But I think we go about it in two different ways. I'm loudly direct and opinionated so that people have a hard time, or at least in my thought process, people should have a hard time. Disambiguating this from my argument. Like, my argument is very clear, very concise. My voice. My tone is very kind of forward and aggressive. That's what I do. But then a lot of people go like, oh, stop, dude, you're being defensive. I'm like. I mean, dude, like, isn't that what.\\n\\nDestiny: Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. So to be clear, I have no problem with your tone at all. I, as somebody that has lived in California for three years, I like east coasters more than west coasters. I like people that are direct and are assholes. Okay? My aunt was 20 years NYPD. She's most direct motherfucker.\\n\\nB: But I'm a west coaster. That's direct.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure, yeah, that's fine. My issue earlier, you weren't. I didn't say you were defensive because you had. You had a particular tone. I said you were defended because you were saying, why am I made to be standing account for my opinions on Finkelstein? Why do I have to answer for this?\\n\\nB: Okay, okay. Well, I was confused. As to why all of the sudden you and I were in a call again, talking about Norm Finkelstein and you. That's, that was just asking that.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, I'd already given that.\\n\\nB: Well, you have to understand that from my perspective, I'm not watching your stream.\\n\\nDestiny: That's fine, but I already, I gave you, I gave you the reason. I said, said, I said because people have interesting opinions about me sometimes and we don't know where these come from. Well, I found one of you that you have an opinion of me, and I'm curious where this comes caus. I have a totally different opinion, this thing. So I laid out the whole reason for why I was interested and I asked you about it, and then it seemed like you were uncomfortable diving into the specific of this particular thing. And then the behavior afterwards, I would interpret it as defensive.\\n\\nB: Okay, well, I'm sorry that it came across that way. I wasn't being defensive. I do this a lot. Like I talk to people a lot. I don't see as what we're doing here as a debate. It's just a conversation, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Well, sure. It's a conversation where we both disagree materially on the facts and we're trying to persuade. We don't have to call it a debate, but I mean, that's essentially what a debate is, right?\\n\\nB: Like I told you yesterday, I'm a bit old school. I think debates have moderators agreed upon positions, time limits and audiences.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, if you want, we can call this an argument. Then, if you want, if you enter a conversation, a conversation where we materially disagree on things that we're trying to persuade the other of is an argument disagreeable conversation. If it's really important to you to use the conversation label, then sure, we can call it a disagreeable conversation.\\n\\nB: ##Ah is it important to you to use the debate label?\\n\\nDestiny: No, but it's important to me to be direct and blunt about the type of conversation that's happening. It's not obfuscate by equivocating.\\n\\nB: Okay. I don't feel like that's what I was doing.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Oay. So then just backing up just some of the initial things. You agree that Norm Finkelstein in our conversation was more of an agitator than an actual, like, scholarly debater? He probably shouldn't have accepted that conversation. It was probably dis on the 20.\\n\\nB: Minutes that I watched. I did prob that I was going to go forward and watch the. But from what I've watched, yes, I feel like he was being an agitator. More than a scholarly historian and debater about the region.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. You, you acknowledge was probably inappropriate for him to accept that debate invitation. It's probably not a good representation of a palestinian defense. Right.\\n\\nB: Okay, well, I said he might not be like, the best guy. He wouldn't be probably the dude that I would tap and go, like, get out there, norm, and convince people.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, hold on. It's not that he wasn't the best guy, is said he was a woefully unequ equipped and inappropriate guy to choose for this, because by your contention, he's just an agitator. So why would he come to a scholarly debate with at least one preeminent israeli historian to agitate is. But do you think that that was an appropriate environment to agitate in?\\n\\nB: I think there's. This is. You're going to learn this about me if we talk more. I think that every situation, especially situations that play out in the public and involve big topics like IP or crime or whatever, I believe that every situation is benefited by having an agitator involved at some point.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. So if Harvard was back in Congress and they had to answer for, you know, their treatment of the student body or whatever, and there was that, I don't know if their president was black or if it was another lady, and I somehow take over one of the mics and I started asking her, like, how do you think about rap music and it's effect on the black community? Why don't you ever talk about black on black crime? Right?\\n\\nB: You arguing with Norm Finkelstein on the Lex Friedman show is not a public fucking proceeding. Like, it's not like a government proceeding. It's not a. It's not.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so agitating, I would have expected you to say, and I know that you feel this way inside, and I'm sure you've said this before, agitating is probably the most important when it comes to government function. No.\\n\\nB: Just talking about somebody going to like the heart. Like a, like a, like a lawsuit for Harvard and going like, he. That guy's a fucking douchebag or whatever.\\n\\nDestiny: Like, I. I don't think it was a lawsuit, it was a congressional. But we. Can we swap it out with anything else? If I were to go to any.\\n\\nB: Hearing, then there are rules and regulations for conduct in those, right? Like you're supposed to. It's the people's business. So you're supposed to be honest. And you were under oath in a congressional hearing, right. If you're being.\\n\\nDestiny: So if Lex had an official code of conduct, then you would say that Finkelstein was totally in the wrong, but because he have a published code of conduct.\\n\\nB: If lex has a published code of conduct that says only scholarly debate allowed on my channel, no agitators need apply. And Norm Finkelstein was invited. I would say that Lex Friedman made a mistake, not Norm Finkelstein.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Because Norm Finkelstein doesn't market himself as a serious academic. He doesn't make a multitude of how.\\n\\nB: He markets.\\n\\nDestiny: Any other program ever.\\n\\nB: You market yourself as a preeminent debate guy, I don't see you that way.\\n\\nDestiny: That's fine. But if you look at all of my public appearances, they are congruent with that.\\n\\nB: Sure, but I don't see you that way.\\n\\nDestiny: That's fine. But if you look at all of my debate appearances, when I think of.\\n\\nB: Destiny, I don't think Lord of the debate. I think of a dude that is pretty knowledgeable, that talks politics on a.\\n\\nDestiny: Fucking podcast, that's fine. But that doesn't. You can have an opinion about things, but our opinions, if we're like making decisions about the world, ideally our opinions are congruent with reality, right?\\n\\nB: Ideally or. Well, I mean, ideally, if we can come to congruency, then yeah, okay.\\n\\nDestiny: But it doesn't matter if you see somebody in a particular way. If Norm thinglesstein has made a variety of appearances across media where he's a serious person and he markets himself as a very serious person, and then Norm is doing a debate where he's asking us to be serious, nor, or, I'm sorry, Lex is doing a debate where he's asking us to be serious, Norm probably should have just said, I'm sorry. I don't think I would be appropriate for this.\\n\\nB: I think le, if he was the one hosting the event, I think Lex should have stepped in and said, norm, you're being inappropriate.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you think that maybe Lex was trying to balance out not seeming like he had a partisanide here that he didn't want to be?\\n\\nB: But if you're going to invite Norm Finkelstein on, and you're going to get Norm Finkelstein, and you don't want Norm Finkelstein, you want him to be scholarly.\\n\\nDestiny: And quiet, which is how he is, and all of the public appearances that he'd made up to that point, do you want me to start linking you some? Do you not think I didn't watch a multitude of videos in preparation for my debate with him? I can give you a ton of different podcast appearances and mainstream immed media appearances where it's normally it's Norm is the one who's appealing to the moderator. You can watch several of his peers. Yeah.\\n\\nB: This is strange to me that you care this much about what a dude you just met yesterday thinks about your norm Finkelstein appearance. It is crazy to me.\\n\\nDestiny: It's not you. Which is why represent you represent that people have such an insanely partisan view of the world that they actually let it shade their factual analysis of the world that a person can, that two different people of different political orientations can watch the same conversation and come away with a complete and total different factual analysis of that conversation. Okay. Like in that one video that I sent you of Briana Joy Greay, where they're talking, I'm pretty sure when she introduces him, she talks about like how scholarly and everything that he is. And he even talks to himself. Like, you thought I was goingna sit there. A 40 years scholarly person.\\n\\nB: I think that their little like raw rah rah part, that thing you linked to me that you had me watch the first three minutes of on two x was pretty cringe. Like they're, the way that they're giggling and laughing and they're, how is it cringe?\\n\\nDestiny: You're, you're part of that group. You're laughing them off. You're like, yeah, he saw them. No, you are. You're directly contribing. You're like, yeah, he sauce him. It him was epic. Because so, because he did. Yeah, but that's what they're laughing about, that you're, you're in that group. Like, if you were in that room, you would be laughing along with them.\\n\\nB: I think that the victory lap, so I can't think that the victory lap was cringe. Even if he sauced you.\\n\\nDestiny: If you thought that he sauced me, why would a victory lap be cringe?\\n\\nB: Because I think victory laps are oftentimes cringe when people are like trying to, like here's, here's what I saw in that video. I saw Brianna Joy Gray and I saw Norm Finkelstein rocking back and forth in his chair, clearly, performatively trying to act like they were way more jazzed up about the fucking victory than they probably were, right. Because they know it's ambiguous. A lot of people agree with you on this, right? A lot of people think Norm Finkelstein showed his ass. A lot of people agree with me on this, that Norm Finkelstein did a good job.\\n\\nDestiny: If I were to go back through all of your conversations over the past couple years, have you done any victory lapse? Kind of like you did earlier, but not to the same level.\\n\\nB: Hell, fucking yes. I still think they're cringe.\\n\\nDestiny: So what does cringe even mean here, then?\\n\\nB: Cringe means cringe. I t. Have you never done anything cringe?\\n\\nDestiny: If I. There's something that I interpreted as being cringe, I try not to do it.\\n\\nB: Right. But you have done things that are cringe. Right. Unfortunately, like, in your long, long fucking Internet history, you've made some cringe. You've posted cringe a few times.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but I generally, like. I wouldn't defend it.\\n\\nB: I'm not defending it. I'm just saying. Yeah, I've taken, like, what I would call victory lapse. Like when Vash's position changed from, you're a fascist. If you questions Biden's, like, ability to run to, Biden must get down. My Biden must step down.\\n\\nDestiny: Now.\\n\\nB: Like, when that flipped, that. That felt pretty good. I mean, he told his audience, I'd be comfortable with you calling him a de facto fascist, because I. Right. Three months ago, and now that the debate happened, Vash has just adopted my position on that, but hasn't retracted the fascism shit. Has banned me from his community, from his chat, from his discord, and from his, whatever stream chat thing. Right. And the only time he's ever addressed me since then has been to call me Brett Keane. So, yeah, I did. I did a couple victory laps on that because I felt pretty vindicated. Okay, but was it cringe? Yeah, kind of. Me thumping my chest about winning an Internet argument is a little cringe, but I work on the Internet. You.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. As we agree that Norm shouldn't have been involved in that debate, he didn't make any good substantive points.\\n\\nB: No, I don't think we agree in that. But I don't think we're gonna get to that point because I gotta go. I got seven minutes before my show starts, so I gotta let you go.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nB: Have a good one, bud.\\n\\nDestiny: Yep. Stay safe. Good luck in your show.\\n\\nB: Yeah, peace.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, now we've hit the. We've hit the next stage. He conceded on, like, every point that I wouldn't expect the person to ordinarily concede on. So what's the next thing then? Do we need to call them out for their false concessions? Because most people would argue. Well, no, hold on. Norm isn't just an agitator. Norm is a serious scholarly historian. I didn't expect to be like. Yeah, no, yeah. Norm is just kind of like an agitator guy. That's all he does. Jesz jus k Christ, I could have. Yeah, I could have brought up. Why didn't you tell your audience you only watched like 20 minutes of it? Y. True. All right. If we were trying to think of things that we consider to be core american values, we'll make a larger subset for, we'll say core american values. And we would. These are non negotiable values that I would expect every single american citizen to have in common. If American can, were to stand for or represent any kind of ethno national idea, this is what, this is what it would represent. Should they be unique to America? It doesn't have to be unique to America. Okay. I think the first thing that I would put is, we'd say a broad adherence to concepts of liberalism. So if we were to describe this, we would say a strong, constitutionally rooted and protected deference to individual freedoms, including things such as private property rights, the right to start and invest in businesses, the right to speak freely and criticize others without fear from government prosecution or. No, this would be persecution. Right? Persecution. Prosecion. We don't want to be prosecuted. We don't want to be persecuted. Persecution, yeah. Equality. No, no. I'll leave that for something else. Yeah. I would just say this. I think this is good for now. A broad adherence to concepts of liberalism. Yeah. Okay. I would just have that. I think that is essential to the idea of being american. I would say that. I would say that respect for rule of law. I think that this is also foundational understanding among the population that we recognize a legal code or a legal system. Wait, I'll write questions for these. To what extent does criticism, some of these values betray the core value itself o understandinging the population that we recognize a legal system that, irrespective of our disagreements, we all agree to follow and.\\n\\nE: Apply.\\n\\nDestiny: To every american citizen. The obvious challengeosed to be like, what about immoral laws? Are things we find morally reprehensible. Reprehensible? Oh, sure, that's a good one. To be represented by a. Democratically. By democratically. Because there are multiple governments. By democratically elected. By democratically constructed governments. Well, democratic out elected governments. Yeah. Well, just say that a respect is given to the separation of powers enshrined in our government. No, enshrined in our constitution. We recognize simultaneously that a delicate balance is struck between and inside of our separate branches that ensures an elite is not able to rule over all of us and any majority is not able to impose their tyranny on something broad here. Democratic personal autonomy is a big thing. You see it in culture, even with cars and stuff. I think that fits under liberalism. Page nine of this post World War two doc, the research a summary page called the fundamental purpose of the United States, multiculturalism. We are a nation of many different peoples. We call this the diversity is our greatest. The United States has no officially recognized ethnic or racial superior ethnic or racial categories. The things that unite us as american citizens are the core values we share and the government that emerges from the Constitution. Do you think american values align more with collectivism or individualism? That binary can be kind of hard to argue sometimes. Unfortunately, we got to say something about religion too, right? It wasnt that a big reason hes found it no to be religious. Yeah. This brought adherence to liberalism. Was going to cover stuff like separation of church and state, stuff like that. Hold on. Skepticism seems to be a core value. Americans don't really believe anything at face value. So when Im saying core values, I saying these are non negotiable values that I would expect every single american citizen to have in common. If American were to stand for or represent any kind of international idea, this is what they would represent. Skepticism is not like a core american. Not everybody necessarily has to be skeptical or whatever. I just reading ideas from chat. A free and fair, not fair media, a free press can operate without fear, nothing un american. How would you say uname Americana Onash American about arguing to the extent that any of these rights should be regulated, however, any proposed regulation should necessarily be in the furtherance, in the furtherance of the idealized form of the right. Correct. Right. So if we were to say something like, let's say that Blackrock ended up buying every single house in the United States, and we were to say, oh, okay, well, this is probably not good. So we're going to ban hedge funds from buying homes, right. Rather than seeing this as like, contrary to the value of having a home, we would say, well, you know, created in the furtherance of everybody else's private property rights, basically, right. Stuff like that. Respect for rule of law and understanding among the population that we recognize a legal system that irrespective of our disagreements, we agree to fall and apply to every american citizen. How do you decide? How do you decide when a law is immoral and shouldn't be followed? Also make the case that right wingers today don't care about the Constitution. If it meant owning the Libs, they would let Trump terminate it. Okay, if I'm trying to that I want to use to argue later on. I dont start with the construction of the framework, with the goal in mind at the end, because that would poison and destroy the entire concept of drawing out some framework from my mind in the very beginning. At that point I might as well, just like theres no point in wasting time doing any of that if you be arguing with whatever. Let's see. Excerpts from a letter to fellow clergyn writers or, I'm sorry, fellow clergyman written from a Birmingham City jail. Excerpts why can't I just find the full letter letter burning ham jail MLK did he just write one famous one? Is this the white moderate one? Isn't it? Holy Christ, yeah it is. Is helping other countries part of it? Is helping other countries a core american value? No, I wouldn't say so. Fuck it. Let's just read all of this. Why not? Letter from a Birmingham jail, August 1963 by Martin Luther King junior from the Birmingham jail where he was imprisoned as a participant in nonviolet demonstrations against segregation. Doctor Martin Luther King Junior wrote in it was his response to a public statement of concern and caution issued by eight white religious leaders of the south. Doctor King, who was born in 1929, did his undergraduate work at Morehouse College, attended the integrated Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, one of his six black pupils, or one of six black pupils among 100 students, and the president of his class, and won a fellowship to Boston University for his PhD. Who would have known that Dei was operating even back then while confined here, the Birmingham City jail? I came across your recent statement calling our present activities. Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all of the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would be engaged in a little else in the course of the day and I would have no time for constructive work. Would you be interested in MLK reading it himself? Does he read the whole letter? Damn, it takes him 1 hour. It's six pages. Is there more here that he speaks about? Okay, dont know, dont care. But since I feel that you are men of genuine goodwill and your criticism, criticisms are sincerely set forth, I would like to answer your statement what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms. I think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham. Since you have been influenced by the argument of outsiders coming in I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some 85 affiliate organizations all across the south, one being the Alabama Christian movement for Human Rights. Whenever why are you spamming this? You should check out the works by John Rawls. If you want to fly? Yes, thank you. Yes. I will read an entire book right now. I will read all of it right now. This's such a great point, dude. Actually, can you recommend me the best John Rawls books? Let's order them right now on Amazon. Sure. Let's just do this right now. Yeah, true, John, which ones? Which ones would you recommend? I can let them up by my Kindle right now. Obviously a theory of justice. What else? What else do I need to read right now? What else do I need to read right now for thisand in two days, the crazy night sky. Please tell me any other authors you recommend too, where I should read. Like what? Tell me. Jesus. Several months ago, our local affiliate here in Birmingham invited us to be on call to engage in a noniolent direct action program, if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented and when the hour came, we lived up to our promises. So I am here along with several members of my staff because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic organizational ties here. Just as the 8th century prophets left their little villages and carried their thus saith of the Lord far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns, and just as the apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ, practically every hamlet and city of the greco roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular hometown. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the macedonian call for aid. Is wanting to be a leader on the world stage and core value championing democracy, freedom? No, I wouldn't say so. Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by an Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial, outside agitator idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider. You deploy the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. This whole paragraph is pretty good. Would we fit this under respect for rule of law? I think it would be. How do you do? Call out. It's this exclamation mark. Quote. Um, hold on. I think. Quote. It's an exclamation mark. Quote. I feel like I'm not doing the syntax right. August of 1963. Oh, wrong thing. If I put this down here. August 1963. Fuck. There's no way to make this no, it's fine. Enough. Okay, whatever. Are you listing things that relate to Americans and how they interact with the government, or do you want how Americans act with other Americans? Both. I think that I, when I argue with people, especially as im making constructive arguments, I think that its good to start from a foundation of like, what do you consider a thing to be? So, like for the United States, what do you consider thing to be? Okay. You deploy the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. But I am sorry that your statement did not express a similar concern for the conditions that brought the demonstrations into being. I am sure that each of you would want to go beyond the superficial social analysts who looks merely at effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. I would not hesitate to say that it is unfortunate that so called demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham at this time. But I would say in more emphatic terms that it is even more unfortunate that the white power structure of this city left the negro community with no other alternative in any nonvioent campaign ##s collection of the facts to determine whether injustices are alive. Negotiation, self purification and direct action. We have gone through all of these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying of the fact that racial injustice in engulf this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of police brutality is known in every section of this country. It's unjust treatment of Negroes and the courts is a notorious reality. There have been more unsolved bombings of negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal and unbelievable facts. On the basis of them, negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers, but the political leaders consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiations. Then came the opportunity last September to talk with some of the leaders of the economic community. And these negotiating sessions, certain promises were such as the promise to remove the humiliating racial signs from the stores. On the basis of these promises, Reverend Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to call a moratorium on any type of demonstration. As the weeks and months unfolded, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. The signs remained, and in so many experiences of the past, we were confronted with blasted hopes and the dark shadow of a deep disappointment settled upon us. So we had no alternative except whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscious of the local and national community. We were not unmindful of the difficulties involved, so we decided to go through a process of self purification. We started having workshops on nonviolence and repeatedly asked ourselves the questions, are you able to accept blows without retaliating? And are you able to endure the ordeals of jail? We decided to set our direct action program around the Easter season, realizing that with the exception of Christmas, this was the largest shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the byproduct of direct action, we felt that this was the best time to bring pressure on the merchants for the needed changes. Then it occurred to us that the march election was ahead. And so we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that Mister Connor was in the runoff, we decided again to postpone action so that the demonstration could not be used to cloud the issues at this time, we agreed to begin our nonviolent witness the day after the runoff. As a real quick thing, I've read decent chunks of this and other writings by MLK. I think I've spoken about this in the past because this month is go going toa be reading and we're gonna read lots of stuff. One thing I want you to take note of is that when people talk about doing protests or demonstrations today, and a lot of people them quotes. Okay. And secondly, okay, I want you to take note of, like, the painstaking analysis that MLK and all of his collaborators, compatriots, whatever people would do when it would come to ethically and effectively constructing protests and demonstrations because of the way that, like, white woke people and college kids today have, like, misrepresented MLK in the past or whatever ironically they call it. They say that people have whitewashed MLK and then they, like, doomerwash him. This weird idea that, like, the real reason why civil progress happened was because Malcolm X was threatening violence on the other end or that, well, you know, even MLK, they had riots and he understood them, blah, blah, blah. MLK in the way that he set out to do everything. Not only was it very intentional, it's not mysterious. He wrote a ton. He gave a lot of speeches wrot this motherfuckers in jail and he's still writing. Okay, the dude is a PhD. He was a prolific writer. Same thing with thes bin Laden. He wrote a lot. You don't have to guess at what these people thought or guess at what these people meant. It's recent history and the writings are available for us to read. Oay just be like, aware of that, okay? That's all I'm saying. Also be aware, too, of what I would consider, at least now maybe I'm a victim of the time. So it seems obvious to me. But I think that in a lot of their protesting and a lot of the demands, they were quite reasonable as well. Right. And they exhausted. This is also important. They exhausted a lot of other means of communication before resorting to nonviolent demonstration. Oay not demonstrations that lacked violence, but the principled commitment to nonviolence as a strategy in demonstrating. Okay, just to be super clear of that. Yeah. So the first step isn't violent demonstrations on college campuses demanding a complete and total withdrawal of all funding from anything'tangentially related to the country of Israel. Right. There would be other exhaustive measures you would take. Yeah. Okay. Are you going to react? A biden speech at the NATO summit now? Noh. Not really. Interesting. Okay. At this time we agree to begin our nonviolent witness the day after the runoff. This reveals that we did not move irresponsibly into direct action. We too wanted to see Mister Connor defeated. So we went through postponement after postponement to aid in this community need. After this, we felt the direct action could be delayed no longer. You may well ask, why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Is it negotiation? A better path? You are exactly right in your call for negotiation. Indeed. This is the purpose of direct action. I watched Paul on a show right after he left here. He immediately caricatured you in what you said. Very disappointing. I'll roast one it next time. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. I just refer to the creation of tension as a part of the work of the nonviolent resistor. This may sound rather shocking, but I must confess that I am not afraid of the word tension. I have earnestly worked and preached against violent tension. But there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension that is necessary for growth. Just as SK greats felt that it was necessary to create so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must see the need of having nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men to rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. I'm sorry this is so crazies. My bad. So the purpose of direct action is to create a situation so crisis pactked that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. We therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down. The tragic attempt to live in monologue rather than dialogue. Wait. Okay. One of the basic points in your statement is that our acts are untimely. Some have asked, why didn't you give the new administration time to act? The only answer that I can give to this inquiry is that the new administration must be prodded about. Wait. Sorry. Ok. The only answer that I can give to this inquiry is that the new administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it acts. We will be sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Mister Boutwell will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mister Boutwell is much more articulate and gentle than Mister Connor, they are both segregationists dedicated to the task of maintaining the status quo. The hope I see in Mister bowell is that he will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from the devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups, individuals, may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture. But as Reinhold Niebuh has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals. Wait. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct action movement that was well timed according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now, I have heard of the word wait. It rings in the ear of every negro with a piercing familiarity. This weight has almost always meant never. It has been a tranquilizing thal thalidomide, relieving the emotional stress for a moment, only to give birth to an ill formed infant of frustration. We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday that justice too long delayed as justice denied. We have waited for more than 340 years for our God given and constitutional rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet like speed toward the goal of political independence, and we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward the gaining of a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, wait. But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will, and drown your sisters and brothers at whim. When youve seen hate filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity? When you see the vast majority of your 20 million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society, when you suddenly find why she cannot go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television and see tears welling up in her little eyes when she is told her that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people, when you have to conc conc, concoct an answer for a five year old son asking an agonizing pathos, daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean? When you take a cross country drive, find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you. When you are humiliated day in and out by nagging sins, reading white and colored, when your first time becomes why are you guys doing this? I already see. You guys need to chill the fuck out, okay? All of you need to calm down. Allgh. All of you in chat stop, okay? Chill, okay? I am a prolific n wor, sir. I don't care. Calm the fuck down. Christ. When you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading white and colored, when your first name becomes a nigger and your middle name becomes boy, however old and your last name becomes John, and when your wife and mother are never given the respected title misses. When you are harried by day and haunted by night, by the fact that you are a negro living constantly at tiptoe stance, never knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fe and outer resentments, when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of nobodinessss, then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, that you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools. It is rather strange and paradoxical to find us consciously break laws. Obey this decision okay, 1 may well ask, how can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others? Okay, so this is what we're looking for. The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws. There are just laws and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that an unjust law is no law at all. Actually. I dont know all of the like legislative rulings and everything. Okay. 54 for Brown v. Board, was this. I don't know the answer to this. When Brown v. Board ruled for. Did this apply broadly to the. Applied broadly to everything, not just schools, right? It was just public schools. Was it just public schools? So like, could you. So after Brown v. Board happens, is it still legal to like segregate? Read the case. Oh boy. Brown v. Board of Education. Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Courtt PDF is it this. These decisions were so short. It's 14 pages compared to the. It's so crazy how short this opinion is. Fuck it. Brown v. Board of Education. This is the syllabus, meaning that this part wasn't written by any of the justices. Is this 14 pages only the syllabus? Council for parties opinion of the court no, it's not. Okay. So it's just very, very okay. Segregation of white and negro children in the public schools of a state solely on the basis of race, pursuant to state laws permitting or requiring such segregation, denies to nego children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th amendment. Even though the physical facilities and other tangible factors of white and negro schools may be equal. The history of the 14th amendment is inconclusive as to its intended effect on public education. The question presented in these cases must be determined not on the basis of conditions existing when the 14th amendment was adopted, but in the light of the full development of public education and its present place in american life throughout the nation. Maybe. See, this is c. Where a state is undertaken to provide an opportunity for an education in its public schools. Such an opportunity is a right which must be made available to all equal terms. To all on equal terms. The segregation of children of public schools solely on the basis of race deprives children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities, even though the physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal. And e. The separate but equal doctrine adopted in Plessy v. Ferguson has no place in the field of public education. There's an asteris a footnote on one of these up here that we read together with number two, Briggs at all. Another case, an appeal from the US District Court of Eastern District, South Carolina arg an appeal from the US. Okay. It's just of whatever. Oh, it's up here for the cor. Okay. And f the cases are restored to the docket for further argument on specified questions. Rel related to the forms of the decrees Council for parties interest. Is that part of the. Oh, it's just arguing or it's just presenting the arguments of the. I guess it would d be the plaintiffs we're bringing forward. Robert LKc Carter argued the cause for appellants in number one on the original argument. And on the re argument. Thurgood Marshall argued the cause for appellants on number two and number two on the original argument. And spots would W. Robinson, the third for appellants and number four on the original argument. And both argued the causes for appellants in numbers two and four in the re argument. Lewis L. Reding and Jack Greenberg argue this cause foronde to number ten on the original. Okay. Okay. So is this et all at all? These are all the people arguing, I think all these different cases. Yes. Okay. This. This has been consolidated. All of these cases, I think, have all been consolidated from all these other cases into one case of the supreme court who'overhearing. Okay. Or it was providing an opinion on, I guess. Okay. On the brief for Robert Al Carter. Blah, blah. Okay. We don't need to read their names. Don't care about this. Okay. Argued this. Okay. This is just. Oh, literally counsel for the parties. Okay. So it's just saying who argued and what. Okay. Mister Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the court. These cases come to us from the states of Kansas, South Virginia and Delaware. They are premised on different facts and different local conditions. But a common legal question justifies their consideration together in this consolidated opinion in the Kansas case, the plaintiffs are negro children of elementary school age residing in Topeka. They brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to enjoin enforcement of the Kansas statute, which permits, but does not require, cities of more than 15,000 population maintain separate school facilities for NRO and white children. Pursuant to that authority, the Topeka Board of Education elected to establish segregated elementary schools. Other public schools in the community, however, are operated on a non segregated basis. The three judge district court convened under 20 USC. I found that segregation of publicose a def effect on negro children, but denied relief on the ground that negro on white schools were substantially equal with respect to buildings from. Okay, okay. The South Carolina case, Briggs v. Elliott. The plaintiffs oreid children of elementary and high school age residing in Clarendon county, they brought the action to enjoyin here to write schools courts sustain the validity of the contestant okay. And then in the Virginia case, deny the request relief court found no and allar case okay. They brought this action okay u a lot education okay algh hold on. Just as a real quick thing for all of these court cases that were consolidated into a single case, this is just an important fact for you to know, just because I see, especially today, especially with his comment, is all the weird nazi revisionism and all the weird historical revisionism that happens in conservative communities. Part of the reason why this was brought before this court, and I believe I haven't read this full opinion, so we'll see if my reading of the opinion was correct. Part of the argumentation is that separ it's not just that separate but equal wasn't good, it's that separate but equal was a myth. It wasn't that we had separate educational institutions in the United States, and then because they were segregated by race, they were no good. It was because we had separate educational institutions. And even if they were found to sometimes have parity with some features, the educational opportunities were not equal among those two things. This was part of the consideration. And that's what, on the footnotes, that's what they're going over in all these cases, that these are the, this is part of the consideration in all these cases that eventually rose up to the Supreme Court. Okay. In each of these cases, minors of the negro race, through their legal, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a non segregated basis. In each instance, they had been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race. This segregation was alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws under the 14th Amendment. In each of the cases other than the Delaware case, a three judge federal district court denied relief to the plain ##s on the so called separate but equal doctrine announced by this court in Plessy v. Ferguson. Under that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided substantially equal facilities, even though these facilities be separate. In the Delaware case, the Supreme Court of Delaware adhered to that doctrine, but ordered that the plaintiffs be admitted to the white schools because of their superiority to the negro schools. The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not equal and cannot be made because of the obvious importance of the question presented, the court ju took jurisdiction. Argument was heard in the 1952 term, and rearument was heard this term, on certain questions propounded by the court re argument, was largely devoted to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the 14th Amendment in 1868. It covered exhaustively consideration of the amendment in Congress, ratification by the states, then existing practices in racial segregation, and the views of proponents and opponents of the amendment. This discussion and our own investigation convince us that although these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive. Most avid proponents of the post war amendments undoubtedly intended, then undoubtedly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among all persons born or naturalized in the United States. Their opponents, just as certainly were antagonistic to both the latter, the letter, and the spirit of the amendments and wished them to have the most limited effect. What others in Congress and the state legislatures had in mind cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. An additional reason for the inconclusive nature of the amendment's history with respect to segregated schools is the status of public education at that time. For a general study of the development of public education prior to the amendments, see Butts and Creman or Kren, history and education blah blah blah school the time of the adoption of the 14th amendment are described in blah blah, blah. Although the demand for free public schools followed substantially the same pattern in both the north and the south, the development of the south did not begin to gain momentum until about 1850, some 20 years after that. The north the reasons for the Sowhat slower development in the south, for example, the rural character of the south and the different regional attitudes towards state assistance are well explained in Coberly and the country as a whole. But particularly in the south, the war virtually stopped all progress in public education. The low status of negro education in all sections of the country, both before and immediately after the war, is described in this compulsory school attendance laws were not generally adopted until after the ratification of the 14th amendment. It was not until 1918 that such laws were enforced in all the states. Okay. In the south, the movement towards free common schools, supported by general taxation, had not yet taken hold. Education of white children was largely in the hands of private groups. Education of Negroes was almost none existent, and practically all of the race were illiterate. In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some states today. In contrast, many Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences as well as in the business and professional world. It is true that time of the amendment had advanced further in the north, but the effect of the amendment on northern states was generally ignored in the congressional debates, even in the north, the conditions of public education did not approximate those existing today. The curriculum was usually rudimentary. Ungraded schools were common in rural areas. The school term was but three months a year in many states, and compulsory school attendance was virtually unknown. As a consequence, it is not surprising that there should be in the history of the 14th Amendment relating to its intent effect on public education. The first cases in the court, in this court construing the 14th Amendment, decided shortly after its adoption. The court interpreted it as proscribing all state imposed discriminations against the negro race as proscribing all state imposed discriminations. Proscribing. Does that mean getting rid of? Presribing means like recommending. And proscribing means recommending against. Forbid? Yes. Okay, prescribing. Why don't we use that word anymore? Do you prescribe something or do you proscribe something? Was negro the common word to refer to black people at the time? Was the writer purposely using the word to emphasize the point? No, this is just. This is what they call themselves. Sorry. It was just like the word. Same thing with, like, colored people. I think, like, it could have a negative connotation because people were racist, but I don't think it was seen as, like a. Like. If you're using that word, it's a. You're being intentionally, like, fucked by doing it. Why don't you pronounce it negro? Is it negro or negro? Negro. I don't know. Where were we? The doctrine separate but equal did not make its appearance in this court until 1896 in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson involving not education but transportation. American courts have since hold on. Footnote six. The doctrine upholding school segregation against attack as being violative of a state constitutional guarantee of equality. Segregation in Boston schools was eliminated in 1855, but elsewhere in the north, segregation of public education has persisted in some communities until recent years. It is apparent that such segregation has long been a nationwide problem, not merely one of sectional concern. Where was I? American courts have since labored with the doctrine. For over half a century in this court, there have been six cases involving the separate but equal doctrine in the field of public education and comingg v. County Board of Education and Gong Lum v. Rice. The validity of the doctrine itself was not challenged. In the coming case, negro taxpayers sought an injunction requiring the defendant school board. Similarly, in the Gong Lum case, the plaintiff, a child of chinese dissecent, contended only that state authorities had misapppllied the doctrine by classifying him with negro children and requiring him to attend a negro school. In more recent cases, all on the graduate school level, inequality was found in that specific benefits enjoyed by white students were denied by negro students of the same educational qualifications, and none of these cases was it necessary to re examine the doctrine to grant relief to the negro plaintiff. In another case, the court expressly reserved decision on the question whether Plessy v. Ferguson should be held inapp applicable to public education. In the instant cases, that question is directly presented here. Unlike Sweet v. Paainter, there are findings below that the negro and white schools involved have been equalized or being equalized with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other tangible factors. In the Kansas case case, the court below found substantial equality as to all such factors. In the South Carolina case, the court below found that the defendants were proceeding promptly in in good faith to complly with the court's decree. In the Virginia case, the court below noted that the equalization program was already afoot and progressing. Since then we have been advised and the Virginia Attorney general's brief on rearument, that the program has now been completed. In the Delaware case, the court below similarly noted that the state's equalization program is well underway. Our decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the negro and white schools involved in each of the cases, we must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education. In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868, when the amendment was adopted, or even 1896, when Plessy ev. Ferguson was written. We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in american life throughout the nation. Only in this, if the segregation of public schools deprive these plaintiffs, deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws. Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship today. It is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values and preparing him for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he has denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state is undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. We come then, to the question presented desegregation of children in public schools, even though the physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities. We believe that it does. And Sweet v. Painter, in finding that a segregated law school for negroes could not provide them equal educational opportunities, this court relied in large part on those qualities which are incapable of objective measurements but which make for greatness in a law school. In McLaren v. Oklahoma state regents, the court, in requiring that a negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations. His ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession. Such considerations apply with added force to children and grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualification generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. The effect of this separation on their educational opportunities was well stated by a finding in the Kansas court or in the Kansas case by a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule against the negro plaintiffs. Quot segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has a sanction in the law, for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to the educational and mental development has a tendency to retard the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system. Whatever may have been the I conclude from the testimony that in our Delaware society state impose segregation and education itself results in the negro children as a class receiving educational opportunities which are substantially inferior to those available to white children otherwise similarly situated. Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is simply supported by modern authority. He'sening to a book. Any language in Plessy v. Ferguson contrary to this finding is rejected. We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal is no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought, are by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This disposition makes unnecessary any discussion whether such segregation also violates the due process clause of the 14 ##th Amendment. Footnote twelve. Okay. Okay. Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and because of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity. On re argument, the consideration of appropriate relief was necessarily subordinated to the primary question, the constitutionality of segregation and public education. We have now announced that such segregation the law. In order that we may have the full assistance of the parties in formulating decrees, the cases will be restored to the docket, and the parties are requested to present further argument on questions four and five previously propounded by the court. For the rearument of this term, the attorney general of the United States is again invited to participate. The attorneys general of the states requiring or permitting segregation in public education, will also be permitted to appear as emiki ki whatever upon request. Curi I don't to do so by September 15, 1954, and submission of briefs by October 1, 1954. I think this is when you're like, this is like when you like, are outside. People are giving an impartial advisor, often voluntary, to a court of law in a particular case. Amicus amic cur is this keai. So when people like write into speak about a particular issue, these briefs will be filed by people that arent necessarily parties to a case. You should recap what youve read every few paragraphs for listeners who dont comprehend. Well, basically, I mean, its only a 14 page decision, not even like a tening. So basically, theyre just arguing that, listen, separate but equal. When the 14th amendment was passed, education wasn't even really a thing in the United States. And any kind of, like, in any kind of standardized way, a consistent way, across all the states. As time has gone on and states have now been providing education, if the state of which you are taxed and you are an entity of the state, you're part of the state. If you're going to be part of this, they're going to be taxes towards it, and the state is going to provide something. Then the 14th amendment, which, which is the amendment that contains not only the insurrection thing, but also is where equal protections under the law, I think, comes from. You're being deprived of your right. You're being deprived of your right under that amendment, because schools have been shown that if they're separate, equal, the outcomes are highly disparate. And it doesn't seem like the separate education is, when provided by the states is doing what they should be doing, basically in accordance or in concordance with this constitutional amendment, just as a quick thing, a reading of the 14th Amendment. Section one. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any state deprive of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protections of the laws. Section two is representatives shall be appointed or apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians, not taxed, but when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president, vice president of the United States, representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a state, and the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such a state, being 21 years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged except for participants, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced, and the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens, 21 years. This is just how you apportion representatives. Im'm guessing this has been superseded by some other amendment or some other thing, right? I think section three is basically defunct because the Supreme Court didn like didn't like Daddy Trump getting ejected from state ballots. Section four is the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts for the payment of pensions and bounties for services and suppressing insurrection, rebellion, shall not be questioned. So I don't know if this established for the ability to the US to have debt, have a debt to issue bonds, maybe. I don't know the history behind each of these amendments, and then, or each of these sections, and then Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. So if Congress wants to make laws about any of these particular things, then they can section three mentions the president, or does it imply it? Section three, this is the section three of the 14th Amendment, was what the huge Colorado case was about. But this section, this is basically the Supreme Court basically said they didnt really like how it was being used to bully Trump, so they kind of got rid of it. But section three says that no person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or elector of president and vice president, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States or under any state who, having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer of the United. Or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or give aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each house, remove such disability. Bay chapter two of John Locke's second Treaties of government, about four pages that our founding fathers adored and eventually plagiarized Sacramento State is a good PEIA for fellow patriots. Okay, gotcha. The Supreme Court quoted section five to dismiss that they might have in their. And I guess it's kind of funny now that we've actually read the Supreme Court decision. Now you can see illustrated in really plain terms, actually. Fuck, do I have this? Fuck. Fuck. What am I looking for? It's research. Legal. US Supreme Court, Trump v. Anderson. Was it Trump v. Anderson? Yes, it was. Do they not mention that in here? I thought they did. I thought they referenced that. Oh, yeah, it is u. Okay, let me see. So it says right here, this was in the Supreme Court ruling about kicking Trump off the Colorado ballot. The Constitution empowers. The relevant provision is section five, which enables Congress, notice how they say enables, not requires, subject, of course, to judicial review, to pass appropriate legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment. Or as Senator Howard put it at the time the amendment was framed. Section five casts upon Congress the responsibility of seeing to it for the future that all the sections of the amendment are carried out in good faith. Congress's section five power is critical when it comes to section three. Indeed, during a debate on enforcement legislation less than a year, Senator Trumbull noted that, notwithstanding section three, hundreds of men were holding office and violating its terms. The Constitution, Trumbull noted, provided no means for enforcing the disqualification necessitating a bill to give effect to the foundational or fundamental law embraced in the Constitution. This is mentioned a few other times, but yeah, they referenced the idea that serious question, blah, blah. Yeah. One of the big arguments that they had made in that opinion was that this statement here saying, the Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions. This was one of the arguments that was relied upon by the court in a kind of 90 decision that was relied upon to say, oh, well, look, section three doesn't apply because Congress hadn't made laws about it. However, as we just read here in Brown v. Board of Education, the opinions of the separate but equal doctrine as it's applied to schools was changed as a result of the. As a result of how the Supreme Court read the 14th Amendment, especially section one of the 14th Amendment, and it didn't require Congress passing a law for them to read it that way. Because when an amendment passes into law, unless there's language specifying otherwise, stuff that is in the Constitution is considered law, full stop. Ok. Remember that just as a quick construction of government, because sometimes I feel like, and I. Maybe I don't think I'm wrong here, but maybe I am, I got into a little argument with the uncivil law guy about, like, oh, the Constitution and federal law. These are different things. Like, no, it's all federal law. It's federal law. I mean, I'm not, like, formally educated here, so maybe I'll disagree if I read something different in the future. But, like, law and the Constitution are different things. The Constitution of the United States is the document which gives power, guidance, authority, everything to the three different branches of government. Oay, meaning that the legislature, who'responsible. For passing laws and who's responsible for creating right. Statutes, legislation. Right. The legislature, right. They get their power to do so from the constitution. So when the legislature passes a law to say that it's a law, like the constitution is laws, I don't know. In legal terms, again, I'm taking a constitutional law class, but I would be surprised if they refer to it in strictly the same manner. The constitution doesn't just, like, have a list of laws, like, the legislature makes laws, because at any point in time, the legislature can be overridden by the constitution. The legislature cannot make things that contradicts the constitution ever. And then when the judiciary is interpreting, like, the legislature, there is no such thing as, like, a conflict between the legislature and the constitution that has to be resolved one way or another. Those conflicts are always resolved with adherence to the every single time. This document is what gives power to all three branches of government. The only way to change the constitution is through the process of constitutional amendment. But a constitutional amendment is not just a new law that's passed, it's a changing of and amending of the Constitution itself. So once a constitutional amendment is suggested and through a huge, rigorous process of state, both halves of Congress and the president, the president must't be in on that right, agreeing. I actually don't know. If the president's involved in signing off and ratifying an amendment, then this document has changed. But then it goes, but just because you change the document, you go back to the exact same thing before in terms of how it gives power to all of these particular entities. So if the constitution says something, then that thing is guiding every with the Constitution, or it shouldn't be. So if it says a particular thing here, no person shall be a senator, representative of Congress because of some qualification, then that is the rule. Period. Doesn't matter. Unless. If there was language in this, in the constitution, this is something like, no provision shall have been seen to have taken effect until or unless Congress passes some law to give cred institute or something. Or to something. Then you could say, okay, but that's not because of something Congress. That's because the Constitution has said or the amendment in the Constitution Senate. But that reading of section five, given. That was given 90 by the court. I think it's a totally bogus reading because, like we just saw, for this, for equal protections, Congress didn't have to pass laws to give effect to section one of the 14th amendment. Congress didn't need to pass a law. As soon as this amendment was added to the Constitution. It's in full force and effect because it's the constitution of the United States and there's nothing in here otherwise that would contradict that. But. Okay, okay. Sorry. Fuck. We got. We went down a thing. Okay, back to our letter. Hold on, wait. Hey, you express a great deal of anxiety. Oh, okay. This is the important part. Okay. Down the line, would you be partial to a deep dive in NSA surveillance? Listen, chill. We've got like 50 billion different things to do a deep dive on, okay? Christ, I don't have time to read every single thing, okay? You express a great deal of anxiety over a willingness to break laws. There are just laws and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that an unjust law is no law at all. Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine when a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas. A aquinas. Ains aquinas right? I should know this'like, a huge catholic debater memmer. I think it's aquinas. An undjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal and natural law. Any law that uplifts all segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of superiority. To use the words of Martin Buber, the great jewish philosopher, segregation substitutes an I it relationship for the I thou relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically onsond, but it is also morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich Tich has said that sin is separation. Isn't segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, an expression of his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Can I urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court because it is morally right? Oh wait, I'm sorry. So I can urge men to obey the 54 decision of ordinances because they are morally wrong. Let us turn to a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Interesting application to the immunity thing. Let me give another explanation. An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama, which set up the segregation laws, was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama, all types of conniving methods are used to prevent negroes from becoming registered voters. And there are some counties without a single negro registered constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured? These are just a few examples of unjust and just laws. There are some instances when a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But when the ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the first amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust. Of course, there was nothing new about the kind of civil disobedience. About this kind of civil disobedience. It was sublimely in the refusal of shadric, Meishach, Shadroc. Are these hebrew names Neb. Jesus fucking Christ, kill me and Abedneo to obey the laws of Nebutri. Because a higher moral law was involved. It was practiced superbly by the early christians who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because socrates practice civil disobedience. We can never forget that. I think these are old christian memes in fucking Rome or some bullshit. Was it king of ancient Babylon during the period of neo babylonian empire? What same shit cringe its pronounced nebuchadadzar. Who asked? Who cares? Nobody. The fuck is this? Okay, thinking of MLK. So, guidance, how do you consider a just versus an unjust law? Some things you could say about unjust laws, according to MLK expanded on in his letter in Birminminam. Just appeal to God. B bed bid. So things that we might say are unjust laws. A law which dictates treatment to a minority passed without any fair input from said minority. A law to dole out different rights to different groups of people. A law that seeks to objectify. Would you say to dehumanize or deprive an individual of the write that the constitution affords us all? Or MLK instead would sorry constitution. He would say natural, moral, religious, whatever rights. Put another one along which is expected it to be followed by some and not others, especially when those who must follow the law are given the law from those who will not follow said law. These are like broad, broad points. I think it's okay. All right. Okay, we'll read the rest of this. We can never forget everything Hitler did in Germany was legal, and everything the hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was illegal. It was illegal to aid in comfort a jew in Hitler's Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my jewish brothers, even though it was illegal. If I lived in a communist country today, where certain principles dear to the christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate disobeying these anti religious laws. Who knew that NLK was based? I must make two honest confessions to you, my christian and jewish brothers. Wow. First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been. I have almost reached to the regrettable conclusion that the negro's great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the Ku Klux Klannner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peacece, which is the presence of justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action, who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom, who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the negro to wait until a more convenient season. Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. So this is obviously, this is the thing that every single fucking lefty likes to cite, justification for, like, killing cops or other insane shit. But obviously, in reading this full letter, right, this comes after a great, like, painstaking deal is meant to elucidate on the steps taken before direct action happens, right? Or the strategy of direct nonviolent action in society. Nonviolent being a keywordd there also after, you know, like, other avenues have been exhausted, right, in your statement. Because this is always just. I always see people just cite this stupid quote as like, this is why we have to kill cops. It's like, okay, in your statement, you asserted that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they press, they precipitate violence. But can this assertion be logically made? Isn't this like condemning the robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical delvings precipitated the misguided popular mind to make him drink the hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness to his will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion. We must come to see, as federal courts have consistently affirmed, that it is immoral to urge an individual to withdraw his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest precipitates violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. Also notice that when MLK is speaking to people, notice that when MLK speaks, notice that he's not doing this like. Like, racial equity is important because black people, black people, black people, black people. Equity is important because. Fuck white people. Fuck white people. Fuck white people. F. Right. When he draws upon examples like, these are all incredibly intentional. MLK doesn't compel you to accept the injustice of segregation because it's mean for black people. Because it's mean for black people, and because white people suck. He compels you to do it because, well, are you not christian? Right? He brings up examples of Jesus, or of people resisting roman prosecution of christians, or he appeals to values in the constitution or our founding fathers. Or he appeals to the affirmation in federal courts. Right? Like when MLK is attacking a white person for their support of segregation. He's doing it not to say that, like, listen, you evil white person, stupid american, fuck this country, right? He's saying that as a person who ostensibly believes in America and values american values, in christian values, look at how you betray your christian values. Look at how you betray your american values. Look at how you betray your federal courts. Look at how you betray the commandments from God. Like, these are the. I'm just saying, just in terms of making it persuasive argument, right? He's stepping inside that bubble. I mean, I'm sure he believes it to. I'm not saying this is like all disingenuous, doesn'tl believeving in this, but like, it's an effective way of arguing with somebody, right? Yeah. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth of time. I received a letter this morning, he didn't believe in time. What a dip shit. That was pretty cringe, though. I'm just kidding. Sorry. I. I'm not kiding. I received a letter this morning from a white brother in Texas which said, all christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually. But is it possible that you were in too great of a religious hurry? It has taken Christianity almost 2000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth. All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time is neutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of goodwill. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence of the good people. We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be cowork workers with God. And without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. So'mlk here is copying me when I talk about how being one of, one of the analogies I use sometimes I appeal to Starcraft, but I'll say things where it's like, people have this misconception that if you don't make a decision that you can kind of like, like stall whatever decision you have to make. Right. You can either make a good decision or a bad weight. But what people don't realize is not making a decision at all is still a type of decision making. And it. Sometimes it'the worst decision all. Sometimes it's better just make a bad decision than to stall and not make one at all. Because time is always moving forward and you can always like, yeah, shit is not good here. But yeah, appealing to that, essentially. And also the general frustration of, if you're black and you live under segregation, having all these white people, you're like, bro, just chill, man. Like, chill. Do you really need to sedating Negroes? Like, come on, man. Like, really, dude? The idea that there can be so much oppression and unjustice and that people are just supposed to, like, kind of chill and wait for maybe it'll resolve itself at some point, and it's like, no, it's only resolving itself because we're resolving it. You spoke of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first, I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolet as those of an extremist. I started thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the negro community. One is a force of complacency made up of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, have been so completely drained of self respect and a sense of somebodiness that they have adjusted to segregation. And on the other hand, of a few negroes in the middle class who, because of a degree of academic and economic security, because it points, they profit by segregation, have unconsciously become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred and comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up over the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's muslim movement. This movement is nourished by the contemporary frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination. It is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incurable devil. I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need not follow the do nothingism of the complacent or the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. There is a more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I'm grateful to God that through the negro, if this philosophy had not emerged, I am convinced that by now many streets of the south would be flowing with floods of blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss our rabble rousers and outside agitators, those of us who are working through the channels of nine violent direct action and refuse to support our ninevioleent efforts, millions of Negroes, out of frustration and despair, will seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies, a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare. Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The urge for freedom will eventually come. This is what has happened to the american negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, something without has reminded him that he can gain it consciously and unconsciously. He has been swept in by what the Germans called the zeitgeist. And with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, he is moving with a sense of toward the promised land of racial justice. Recognizing this vital urge that is engulfed the negro community, one should readily understand public demonstrations. The negro has many pent up resentments and latin latent frustrations. He has to get them out. So let him march sometime. Let him have his prayer pilgrimages to the city hall. Understand why he must have sit ins and freedom rides if his repressed emotions do not. This is not a threat. It is a fact of history. So I have not said to my people, get rid of your discontent. But I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled through the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. Now this approach is being dismissed as extremist. I must admit that I was initially disappointed in being so categorized. But as continued to think about the matter, I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist. Was not Jesus an extremist? In love, love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Pray for them that despitefully use you. Was not Amos an extremist for justice? Amosos, Amos. Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream. Was not Paul an extremist? For the gospel of Jesus Christ? I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Was not Martin Luther an extremist? Here I stand. I can do no other, so help me God. Was not John Bunyan an extremist? I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a mockery of my conscience. Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremist? This nation cannot survive half slave and half free. Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremist? We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal. So the question is not whether we will be extremist, but what kind of extremist we will be. Will we be extremists for hate, or will we be extremists for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation, or will we be extremists for the cause of justice? I had hoped that the white moderate would see this. Maybe I was too optimistic. Maybe I expected too much. I guess I should have realized that few members of a race that is oppressed, another race, can understand or appreciate the deep groans and passionate yearnings of those that have been oppressed, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers have grasped the meanings of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too small in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some, like Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry golden, and James Dabs, have written about our struggle in eloquent, prophetic and understanding terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the south. They sat in with us at lunch counters and rode in with us on the freedom rides. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of angry policemen who see them as dirty nigger lovers. They, unlike many of their moderate brothers, have recognized the urgency of the moment and sends the need for powerful action antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. Let me rush on to mention my other disappointment. I have been disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your christian stand this past Sunday in welcoming negroes to your baptist church worship service on a non segregated basis. I commend the catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring HLL College several years ago. But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I've been disappointed with the church. I do not say that as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say it as a minister of the church who was nurtured in its bo. Bosom, bosom, bosom, right, who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the court of life shall lengthen. I had the strange feeling when I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery several years ago that we would have the support of the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the south would be some of our strongest allies. Instead, some few have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders all to many others, have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing. Anesthetizing. Anesthetizing. That was correct. Anesthetizing security of stained glass windows. In spite of my shattered dreams of the past, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and with deep moral concerns, serve as the channel through which our just grievances could get to the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand, but again, I have been disappointed. I have heard numerous religious leaders of the south call upon their worshippers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the. But I have longed to hear white ministers say, follow this decree because integration is morally right and the negro is your brother. In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the negro, I have watched white churches stand on the sidelines and merely mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities in the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice. I have heard so many ministers say, those are social issue to do with. And I have watched so many churches commit themselves to a completely otherworldly religion which made a strange distinction between bodies and souls, the sacred and the secular. There was a time when the church was very powerful. It was during that period that the early christians rejoiced when they were deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days, the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion. It was the thermostat that transformed the moors of society. Wherever the early christians entered, a town and power structures got disturbed and immediately sought to convict them for being disturbers of the peace and outside agitators. But they went on with the conviction that they were a colony of heaven and had to obey God rather than man. They were small in number but big in commitment. They were too God intoxicated to be astronomically intimidated. They brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests. Wow. Wait. Hold on 1 second. Things are different now. The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church, as often a vocal sanction of things as they are. But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions and be dismissed as an irrelevant social ##h century of I meet young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust. I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham. Even if our motives are presently misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation. Because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with the destiny of GI of America. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here before the pen of Jefferson scratched across the pages of history the majestic word of the Declaration of independence. We were here for more than two centuries. Our four parents labored here without wages. They made cotton king and they built the homes of their masters in the and yet, out of a bottomless vitality, our people continue to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands. I must close now. Before closing, I am impelled to mention one other point in your statement that troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping order and preventing violence. I don't believe you would have so warmly commendeded the police force if you had seen its angry, violent dogs literally biting six unarmed, nonviolent negroes. I don't believe you would so quickly commend the policemen if you would observe their ugly and inhuman treatment of negroes here in the city jail, if you would watch them push and curse old negro women and young negro girls, if you would see them slap and kick old negro men and young boys and if you would observe them as they did on two occasions, refusing to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I'm sorry that I can't join you in your praise for the police department. It is true that they have been, that they have been rather disciplined in their public handling of the demonstrators. In this sense, they have been publicly nonviolent. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the last few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. O where's that quote for Dan? So I have tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends, but now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or even more, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Don't let Dan see that one. I wish you had commended the negro demonstrators of Birmingham for their. No, that doesn't really hard me. Never mind. I wish you would commended the negro demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer, and their amazing discipline in the midst of the most inhuman provocation. One day the south will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, courageously and with a majestic sense of purpose, facing jeering and hostile mob and the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered negro women, symbolized in a 72 year old woman of Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people, decided not to ride the segregated buses, and responded to one who inquired about her tiredness with ungrammatical profundity. Profundity. My feats is tired, but my soul is rested. They will, young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolent, sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience sake. One day the south will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for the best in the american dream and the most sacred values of our judeo christian heritage. Never before have I written a letter this long, or should I say a book. I'm afraid that this is too much, that this is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk. But what else is there to do when you are alone for days in the dull monotony of a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think strange thoughts, and pray long prayers? If I have said anything in this letter, that it is an understatement of the truth and is indicative of an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me if I have said anything in this letter that is an overstatement of the truth and is indicative of my having a patience that makes me patient with anything less than brotherhood. I beg God to forgive me yours for the cause of peace and brotherhood. Martin Luther King. Dru u okay, well, where is that? Why are you reading this? I think that MLK could have used more n words when you think about, like, what it means to be an for law. However, there have been times in american history where we have found it necessary to protest such laws or some laws. So the question becomes, how do you separate, say, the nonviolent protesters in Birmingham from the protesters on January 6, from the protesters for the BLM riots, from the people that marched in Charlottesville, from the people that participated the Rodney King riots from. Right. Some of these things we want to condemn, some of these things we want to support. How do you choose which, and can you be said to have a respect for rule of law if you're protesting against a particular law by breaking the law? Right. Don't know. Oh, ew. For a call out. ##uck there's really no way to do I have to put this on a whole separate thing. Oh shit, this got fucked. Why is it so gross? I think I'll work american history of federalist papers. I don't know if I have, if my mind is developed enough yet to write anything worth. I imagine itop go through significant revision. That's okay, though. Okay. Not in source mode. Why the fuck does this look like it's being written as? Why is it doing this? Is there a way to make call outs work within outlines that aren't gross calls using obsidian? Hmm. How to make an outline call out o. They're doing css here. Fuck. This way here has a bunch of stuff on rule of law. Cute. Go to file. I feel like I've had other, oh, I just stuck the colletss at the end. Fuck. Was that really what I did? I can't have the call. I can't have like an embedded, acutely embedded call out. Go to file. Notes. We had a supreme court thing. Was it this one? Oh, yeah, wait, this looks fine. What was the difference here? The fuck. And it's like one space after view source. Um. The fuck? Why does this work so well? It's because I have this extra bullshit here. The space. Oh, fuck. That was it. Okay. Okay, so no, it's not working. Ah. Does it only work for the first header? Who joined?\\n\\nE: What's up, buddy? Oh, long time no chat.\\n\\nDestiny: What's up? Is it Wednesday today? It's not even Wednesday. How are you doing? How's life going?\\n\\nE: Drama right now. What do you do this time, o?\\n\\nDestiny: It's good.\\n\\nE: Just working. Just mo into a house and shit. It's just been like taking a lot of time, but finally back into the groove. How about you?\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Just doing, I'm just reading. Doing lots and lots of reading. What's up?\\n\\nC: Reading.\\n\\nE: Yeah, you're doing a lot of boring shit when there's a lot of exciting drama going on. You're like, you're in this political world. There's all this stuff going on. It's like, ooh, Netanyahu did this. Hasan did this cringe. Let's talk about boogie 2988. Okay. All right, we're gonna hop right into it. What do you know about boogies crypto scam? What do you know about this?\\n\\nDestiny: Nothing at all.\\n\\nE: Nothing at all.\\n\\nDestiny: Nope.\\n\\nE: All right, we're gonna have a chat about it. All right, so boogie, as everyone in chat knows, is a. Is an epic lol cow. Okay. He's falling. Used to be seen as the Mister Rogers of YouTube, and now everybody just basically sees him as retarded. But I would argue there was, like, a little bit of charitability he had from large youtubers because I think they thought he was just, like, dumb. Like, he's mostly just an idiot. But now he's been exposed for running a pump and dub crypto scam on what's remaining of his audience. And his explanation is he didn't know what he was doing. I don't really buy that. I think he was lying. I think he knew the entire time, mostly because the. The service he was using was called pump fun, which is literally.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, based.\\n\\nE: I mean, it's. Yeah, it is based.\\n\\nDestiny: It is based.\\n\\nE: But he somehow didn't know. He somehow didn't know. But Coffy Zilla did this really good interview with him, and you can, you can basically catch on to boogies blatant manipulation tactics. And I think it would be excellent for you to check out on stream, which is why I'm gonna dm it to you right now. I'm not doing any spoilers on this. Okay. Chat. You're not getting any spoilers. This is all new information. Okay. I'm not going toa turkey. Tom it up. Yeah. Let's check this out. Chat.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, hold on 1 second. Oh, on Avenue yeahes, they got manipulated.\\n\\nE: Into not posting a talk with him.\\n\\nC: Whoa.\\n\\nE: Shocking.\\n\\nDestiny: Alle not posting a talk with who?\\n\\nE: I assume they mean boogie.\\n\\nDestiny: I didn'tie like five years ago.\\n\\nE: Well, you got manipulated five years ago, little bro. You're nothing. Kelly Jean joins. Dan joins XQC joints. That sounds like it would be a nightmare. Get them all in. Everyone'spamming them on twitter now. U have we covered sketch yet? Oh, we will. Marshall. Marshall with five lwls. He's taking him. We'll be covering it don you worry.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. We're fine for this for now. Okay. We don't need any more this right now. Close this. Okay. Jesus. Oh my God. I just got the best fucking idea ever. Holy shit.\\n\\nE: Gay sex today.\\n\\nDestiny: I confronted u. You should give since I'm a boring fucking reading streamer. Now you, you, you should do like a 45 minutes or like a 30 minutes drama segment where you can call in into anything else. We'put you up on the Tv and then you can just like say like heres some drama going on and then give us your take on it and then well link your shit and all that and well go. That would be a be a is genius idea. Would. I should do that. But we can do it here now. No, fuck, Dan. No, I'm kidding. Maybe we'll look at this. Okay. Wait.\\n\\nE: Kids are loved by him.\\n\\nDestiny: Damn. Kids are loved by him.\\n\\nE: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Okay. Don't care about this. We've got. Did I open your video? Okay. Confronting boogie 2988 on Cryptoscam. Oh, I opened this and somebody in my chat was like, this is boring, don't watch it.\\n\\nE: It's not boring. That chatter was retarded. The chatter wants to see, read. Coffeezilla got him. Caught him in the act.\\n\\nDestiny: All right. Do you want me to start or.\\n\\nE: Yeah, can you just screen share me in and I'll give a little context real quick?\\n\\nDestiny: It's really hard for me. Wait, no, wait. Didn't I figure out a way to do this?\\n\\nE: You can't just do it on discord. Is that hard?\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, okay, it's like a second computer that you're looking at on stream. I've got two servparate computers, so I can't just screen share because it doesn't have access to that screen.\\n\\nE: I'll follow.\\n\\nDestiny: There was a way that we were doing this. I just't remember how we did it, but there was a way to do it. I don't remember how.\\n\\nE: It's fine. Basically the deal is Boogie was he adopted this kind of Andrew Tate Persona where he was, he's a fat ass. So he takes his shirt off, he's wearing glasses, he's got his girlfriend next to him on stream in her underwear. And he's like, I'm going to help you all figure out how to be broke. It's kind of a tongue in cheek thing, right? This crypto thing. And for that reason I don't really feel bad for anybody who got quote unquote scammed by him because he was literally pitching it as like it is a pump and dump oay. The criticism I think comes down to the fact that Boogie didn't even know himself what he was promoting. He's a retarded person. And he also admits in this interview to being a fan of so he knew exactly what he was doing. Like he watches all this shit happen. But for some, for some miraculous reason he's like, I didn't know what a pump and dump was, didn't know what he was doing. It's kind of the classic boogie playing the victim when he's caught. But this interview I think will be an excellent watch and you'll love it. You'll catch on his manipulation show. Like Boogie's like a BPD girl when you catch her. Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. I'm gonna two exit and start listening for a bit. Okay.\\n\\nE: Ok.\\n\\nG: Boogie 208 eight on a crypto pump and dump he did and he said that he thought that just because he said, hey, don't buy this unless youre re rich, the nobody was gonna put their money in. A few hours later, $3 billion worth of trading volume had been done. And I tried to tell him and explain to him that's how these deals work. Insiders pay you the celebrity to go ahead and promote something. They payid him $10,000 and then people up buying the que. Doesnt t matter what you say, the whole point is theyre renting your likeness, renting your image in order to do that. He then told me, well, you know, basically hes paying for cancer so he cant pay that money back. Its all spent. Money spent, moneys gone. And I tried to get to thett of why he did it, why I think that he didnt actually care.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, does Boogie have cancer?\\n\\nE: Does he have what?\\n\\nDestiny: Does Boogie have cancer?\\n\\nE: Yeah, he says he has blood cancer.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nE: A lot of people don't believe it but he claims to have blood cancer, I think.\\n\\nG: Okay, whether it was a scam or not because he actually came to me ahead of time. It was a really weird story where he came to my DM's before he fully launched the coin. He just an announcement tweet saying hey, you know pump do fun which is the platform he was launching on. And then he said to me, hey I got question for you, something like that. And I said, I looked at his twitter profile and I said dont do what I think youre about to do. And he said oh it, its too late. Like I already spent the money, hospital bills and stuff. So who bus scams if you thought it was all on the up and up? Because that's what he tries to say is no. If I'd only know, if I'd only seen ahead of time but this was I wouldn't have done it. U very strange story though, I want you to hear.\\n\\nDestiny: Well it's obvious why he went to him is because he was basically trying to say like well I went to coffee Zilla first and we chatted about it so I figured everything would be good. It's like he's like covering his tracks or basically right. Or covering his ass really. Right.\\n\\nG: But from boogie 2988 himself though about this, decide what you think. In general I think it's fine to say people should not be investing in memes. I just think it's also obvious that marketers wouldn't pay people if people didn't fall for this. Stu, ultimately they are scamming your fans. They get in on. I hope we can continue to expose celebrities who do this, such as boogie. Desperate or not. It s not okay. There are other ways to make money. And yeah here'the call we had boogie it looks like you launched a crypto token. That is a scam. A pump and dump. What do you have to save for yourself?\\n\\nC: I dont think it its a pump and dump. It is a meme coin.\\n\\nG: Its literally from a thing called pumpt fun. What you talking about?\\n\\nC: I never knew who pump fund was until today.\\n\\nG: Well that's what you tweeted. That's what you tweeted. You said oh we'renn break.\\n\\nC: I learned about it today. So I also tweeted about it today. Try to find a time I twee about before that. You won't because I just found out I didn't know who this company is. These people working with other than they came referred to me by Afroman's manager.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nG: But you said before you posted the pump d because you'cr Internet pump fund you didn't realize that point. You're doing a pumpin dump that you're getting paid by insiders to do this.\\n\\nC: Well not really because again, if you watch the video that I launched this with, the entire video, the entire bit, the entire joke is I lost all of my money in crypto. But I'm here to tell you the truth and the hacks to help you break free from the matrix so you can be a brokeie like me. Trw happiness comes from a goldfish. From the same woman a couple of nights a month and the occasional meme coin. Fatty for life. Here's my shit coin. If you want to be broke too, buy my shit coin. That's what I say in my tweets.\\n\\nG: What's the joke about you getting paid to do this, though, and asking people to invest in this co. I mean, what's the joke exactly? You know, people are gonna invest. That's why you're getting paid. You know that people would buy one.\\n\\nC: Coin to come onto the server and hang out, fuck around. That's what I thought. That's my understanding. And that was the point, you know, when they were pitching this to me, they're like, don't be like Logan Paul. Don't be these other people. We want you active in the community. We want you to talk. We want you to be there. This is your community. Be part of it. And so it seems very easy for me to do this with another company to collect.\\n\\nG: You were asking people to invest in a financial, not just a community. Right. You understand that? This is not like, hey, pay a buck and you get access to my community. People think that they're going to make money. That is why there's three.\\n\\nDestiny: Hmm. I justnna give you a quick insight. We're gonna take a quick, a quick manipulator break. Okay. U. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can expand upon these rules, like, explicitly, but there is a thing that manipulators do where they will claim that they're not doing a particular thing. But then in the course of arguing about whether they're doing that thing, at some point in the argument, they'll begin to justify the thing that they said before that they weren't doing. It's a little slick. It's probably unintentional, but it is incredibly mind fucking. Let's say that you come home and somebody, you find that your dog is acting a lot differently than you'd expect it to, and you asked a friend to babysit the dog. So you go up to the friend, you're like, yo, what's going with my dog? Like, what do you mean? Like, were you like, were you pissed off at my dog? Did you attack my dog? Like, why is he so, like, scared? Why is he in the corner? Whatever. I like, no, I. No, I would never do that, me and your dog, at all. And fine. We were great. Everything's great. Everything's fine. Really? And then you start pushing, and then they're like, listen, I never do the dog. Hey, listen, your dog barks, like, all fucking day, okay? I like, holy shit. Like, he barks all the fucking time. He shits all over the fucking floor. He pisses everywhere like he eats his fucking dog food. Something that is happening here. And I don't think people realize, well, I don't think the person doing it realize what they're doing ca because they wouldn't do it. And the person arguing with them often doesn't realize it. What's happening is, is when you say when they start giving justifications for a behavior that they initially said they didn't do, they did do that behavior. And now in their mind they've moved on to trying to justify and defend themselves about not doing it at all. It's super manipulative and it's really mind fucking because then the other person will start arguing the justifications, not realizing, hold on, wait, wait, wait. So if you're saying my dog doodle, he, okay, fine, maybe he did, but so then you did kick my dog, right? You attacked him, right? You're justifying now why you attack him. You understand this what you're doing, right? People don't catch this. What boogie is doing here. Boogie is deploying this. Initially the coin is just a joke. It's just a joke. I didnt t think any was actually fucking doing any itthing. It'a joke fucking meme coin. Right? But then it's like, what are we making justifications for now? They said that I was gonna participate in the community. I'm not gonna be like the polls. I'm actually gonna go my community participate. I just saw people like buy one so they gain access to the discordse. Right? Well, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. First you said it was a joke, but now you're justifying why the coin was a good buy, so was it not a joke? Did you actually intend to have this be a product? Right? Notice that right now boogie is defending the very proposition that he denied, which is that this is a coin that's meant to be purchased by people as a serious, in the beginning of the conversation, just as a quick manipulator thing to point out, but okay company to collect.\\n\\nG: You were asking people to invest in a financial product, not just a community, right? You understand that? This is not like, hey, pay a buck and you get access to my community. People think that they're going to make money. That is why there's $3 million of trading volume on this little shitcoin that you just promoted.\\n\\nC: I told them they won't make money. I literally told you, you go broke buying this coin, you, you can't. In the tweets and in the videos, I said don't buy this coin. You'go broke if you want to be broke like me by this coin.\\n\\nG: There's literally no way you believe you're gonna get paid $10,000 for something. And those people aren't expecting a greater return on their investment. This is how mem coins work money back.\\n\\nC: But, I mean, there are plenty of companies that I've worked with that are just there to get their name out, and they're glad to make their money back or even spend the money to get name recognition.\\n\\nG: I can name Az these people are spending money to get pump fund meme coin name recognition, I presume. Let me explain how this works. Let me explain how this works. Pump up fun is a place where a lot of things happen. But celebrities will launch memeeccoins. How itworks is insiders pay them for their brand to juice. They have the influencer promote it. The price jumps up, because no matter what the influencer says, the attention gets people to put money in the stupid project. No matter how much you tell them, oh, it's a meme, guys. It's just a joke. It's just a fun little joke. They're gonna put their money in cause they like you and they're gonna get rugged. They're gonna get destroyed by the insiders who got in early on the coin. They have all the advantage cause they got an early. All your fans have the disadvantage because they got in late. These coins always spike at the beginning. They always die. You think you're gonna be around this community for a long time. You're not. Within six months, this thing is gonna be dead.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes and no. He's saying that the coinsolute is obviously a sham and not a smart investment. So if you invest in it, you're throwing money away to be part of the community. Still stupid, though. No. The goal is to do a pump and dump because. Thank you very much. It's so easy to see that if you really truly did mean this to just kind of be like a meme thing, then you would, like, limit the upside, right? You would. I don't even know. I'm sure you can build this functionality into coins, but you would limit, or you just wouldn't even make it a crypto at all. You would just make it some digital purchase that, like, flags a discord account or some bullshit. The fact that you're letting people buy in as much as possible means that the potentiality for a pump and n is there. And when you're working with a site called WW Dot pumpcoin or whatever the fuck.com and you're getting paid $10,000 to promote it. It's pretty obvious what's going on.\\n\\nE: The thing is, like, why would he even promote it in the first place for free? Like, am I really supposed to believe that?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, he's getting paid for it, right?\\n\\nE: Yeah, he's getting paid. Exactly. That's the entire point. And, like, he can, like, you know, joke about it. It's like, oh, you know, I'm, you know, not responsible or whatever because I said not to buy it. But, like, then you're also, like, talking about how it's valuable, how you're building a community, how there's a.\\n\\nDestiny: Exactly. Yes, yes.\\n\\nE: Invest in it.\\n\\nDestiny: You're justifying the thing you just said you weren't doing. You said it was just a meme, but now you're saying why it was worth selling to people in the first. So which is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nE: And I mean. I mean, I think the truth is obviously the bad intention, which is what boogie wanted, but I think it's pretty clear. I don't know how you feel about it, but I think the reason he messaged coffee first is to, like, avoid responsibility or, like.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, that's what I said. Because he can say that. Like. Yeah, because, like, bro, I messaged you. Like, come on, dude. Wait, are you really gonna light me up on this? Like, dude, I mess at you and I talked about it, right? Like, it's that appeal to. Yeah, that bullshit in the beginning.\\n\\nE: Yeah. And the worst part about is, like, boogie could make videos to make money. He, like, refuses to. And he also, like, has a bunch of trash in his house. Like, he has, like, I want to say, like, $10,000 at least worth of, like, funko pops and arcade machines, they like, if you're going through, like, cancer treatment and you can't pay for it, you should probably be selling that off first before you're scamming your audience. Right. But he refuses to do that. He refuses to take any responsibility for his own life. It's always just, well, you know, I'm fucked, so I'm just gonna scam people. And then when he does scam people, it's like, okay, well, it's not really my fault, and this is why'someone. Else's fault. And I didn't know what I was getting into. And these guys are responsible.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. Although I would say careful on the terminology, like, scamming his audience for the cancer. I mean, if he's honest about why he's doing it, it's not really a scam. His audience is just stupid. Right?\\n\\nE: But, I mean, yeah, the audience is pretty dumb. But I still think he faces some responsibility, at the very least for the lying.\\n\\nDestiny: Which way? Lying about what?\\n\\nE: Well, because on one hand, he's like, I never told anyone to use it. I said it was shit. And then he's also just saying it's like, cool.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, no, no. I'm sorry about the crypto thing. I agree. In particular, I was just saying that, like, you can't say that he's scamming people about the cancer donations, because if he's honest, like, I need this for cancer shit. And I do well with fungo bumps. That's not really. But this is probably kind of a scam. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. The only thing that would significantly change my mind on this, and I haven't done any reading into this at all, the question would be, is, was boogie open about the fact that he was getting paid $10,000 to promote this before it all went down?\\n\\nE: I honestly couldn't tell you that. I don't remember. He did say it in this recording, but I'm not sure if he said it beforehand. I would. I would guess not, but I'm not sure.\\n\\nDestiny: All right, talk to. Exactly.\\n\\nG: There it is.\\n\\nC: Left the server. But if there's people to talk to, I'll talk to them.\\n\\nD: Why wouldn't I?\\n\\nG: Because you got paid upfnt.\\n\\nC: Sure.\\n\\nG: Okay.\\n\\nC: I don't know if you understand what my life is like right now, but I have so much free time that I spend a lot of it on my discord now because I'm just bored out of my mind. I don't have places to go. I don't have money to spend.\\n\\nDestiny: Why not? Not to sound like ableist, but if you have all this free, my friend, and it doesn't even have to be, like, boring, horrible work, like, make YouTube videos. You have a channel with millions, right, boog?\\n\\nE: 4 million subs, bro. Yeah, he refuses to. He refuses to make videos.\\n\\nDestiny: All this talk. What the fuck? Okay, listening more.\\n\\nC: I'm literally just fighting for my wife over here. And a lot of that involves staying home, spending my money where it needs to be spent, and trying to just not stress myself out to make my polycythemia vera.\\n\\nDestiny: Anyere.\\n\\nG: How total?\\n\\nC: I was given $5,000 upfront with a promise of $5,000 on the backend after a week of coming on the Telegram, doing some live streams, doing some tweets about it, and all along the ways, talking about how it's a chip coin that will ll make you go broke.\\n\\nDestiny: One thing I'm curious, I don't know if. I don't know if Kffi Zzilla will drill into this. He said he got five k up front and then five k for continued work. So there are two ways that this could have gone. One would be very interesting. So. So one standard way would be $10,000 contract. You get five k upro frontt. You get five k after a week. But a second way that that contract could have been written is you get five k up front and you'll get five k if they hit a certain volume. And that second one would be a killer point. Do they go? I hope. Don't spoil. If they do go into it, I hope he asks him if that second payment was contingent upon a minimum volume for the coin. We'll see.\\n\\nG: You know why they tell you to do it for a week, right? That's how much time they need to get out, out of the coin. They're gonna slowly drain the coin as people. By end, they're gonna use whatever's worth of your name to dump on your fans. You know that.\\n\\nC: Well, I. If you're telling me that, I believe you.\\n\\nG: That's how meme coins work. I told you in DM's not to do this. You came to me cause you were about to launch this coin was launch.\\n\\nC: You told me after my first week. I literally said to you the question for. But at that point, it was already too late. The first tweet was out.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, now here's boogie. So remember he laid the trap by asking him a few weeks earlier, right? Like, bro, I came to here, he'now, he's like, invoking that basically, like pardon power. Like, I already talked to you, so I should be clear, right, bro, you can't go after me. I asked you questions, right? We already talked about this.\\n\\nG: Yeah, no, you know, no, no, no. There was no contract. There was no video out.\\n\\nC: The money's already spent's's at mercy hospital right now. It's gone. I use it to make debt. I used to pay medical that so.\\n\\nG: You didn't have to tweet that.\\n\\nD: Twee.\\n\\nG: You didn't have to tweet it out. Came, said you like, did the like, pre announcement hype thing. And then you sent, you sent me a message asking me, oh, I've got some questions. I immediately tell you don't do it. Then you don't listen to me. You say it's too late to cast a check, need it for medical bills. Isn't it just a shit coin, a meme. No one's actually gonna buy the thing. And then $3 million worth of trading volume happened.\\n\\nC: Yeah, I was not expecting that, obviously.\\n\\nG: You know who was expecting that? The people who paid you.\\n\\nC: I obviously don't want anybody to lose money. I thought there was going to or Patreon are only fans to have some personal interaction. That's what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting anybody to think they're going to make money from this, especially because I specifically told them, you will not make money from this.\\n\\nG: Don't you think it's kind of gross given that you know firsthand, almost better than anyone, the damage that speculative investments can do, that you would then make money from a speculative investment like this?\\n\\nC: I put my money in the crypto market in the wrong section and I pretty much lost most of everything.\\n\\nDestiny: Right?\\n\\nC: That's why I'm telling people, don't make a speculative investment here because I lost my ass. Like, if you watch the video, hopefully you'll include it in your video, parts of it. But in the video I talk about how broke I am, how I lost my money on crypto. I talk about if you want to be broke like me, join my community and.\\n\\nG: Right, you're doing a satire of Andrew Tate's crypto coin. That's what you're doing.\\n\\nC: Yeahahah.\\n\\nDestiny: Where.\\n\\nC: Okay, where is he saying join it, make money? I'm saying join it, lose money.\\n\\nG: And you think that's okay to then financially tie money for yourself where you can hur your audience. Do you think that's fine as long as you say, oh, join it, you can lose some money.\\n\\nDestiny: I will say, well, you can almost be endlessly critical of boogie for a huge variety of reasons. While I think that, I don't know if I would say, boog, get anything wrong here or say he's being a fucking retard. Maybe. Or maybe the fact that he's so, like, he's not honest about it is like the wrong part. But if boogie is like going on like, buy brokecoin, buy broke bitchcoin, buy broke ass coin and then you buy it and it ends up being a pump and dump, I think I have exactly zero sympathy for anybody that buys it. I'm like, I mean, fuck, bro, what the fuck did you expect? I mean, what? Jesus Christ.\\n\\nE: Yeah, I don't feel bad for those people. I think.\\n\\nDestiny: And I don't even know if boogie, like, I don't know if boogie did anything wrong though.\\n\\nE: It wasn't that it's like, it's boogie. It's fucking boogie. Like, why the fuck are you buying a coin from this idiot?\\n\\nDestiny: Sure.\\n\\nE: Anything about him, you find this guy's like a liar. Like, pathologically.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Well, yeah, but in this case, he's not even lying if he's literally saying, listen, buy be broke. Like me, la la la la bl. Like, if be's saying shit like that. I mean, you can't really say promoted even if the coin does end up like. But okay, I think part of the.\\n\\nE: Problem is he says it's not a pump and dump. And then it like, definitely.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, that's why I'm saying when he lies. Yeah, exactly. When he lies about it, that's the problem. Yeah. Like, his behavior right now, like, if he would just come come on a call like this, he's like, you know, v coffee zillow is like, yo, what's going on? And he's like, I guess the company hired me was a pumping dump. So, yeah, I mean, I guess I was more right than I knew when I told you that if you buy it, you're gonna be broke bitch like me. So, yeah, if you did, yeah, you're pretty fucked. It was pumped and dumped. If boogie was like that, I think. Yeah, okay, you're clear. So I think any wrong, any moral wrong that, um, boogie is saying, I think it's just because of that behavior afterwards.\\n\\nE: But I don't know, y. I mostly agree.\\n\\nDestiny: Still listening.\\n\\nG: Even though, you know, with your following, people are goingna invest in that.\\n\\nC: I mean, I'm steadfast in this. Yes, yes. I believe that. If I got paid to tell you don't buy something, I'll gladly take that money. If I get paid to tell you this will might be dangerous for you. Invest smartly. Yes, I think I would love to get paid. I'd love to be paid to be an example of somebody who lost their ass in crypto. And I teach people that very important lesson. I think that's a very good lesson to lear.\\n\\nG: You think making people lose money, that's a good lesson?\\n\\nC: No, I wanted to keep them from doing that. I wanted to get the message out to make sure they didn't. That's the point. I thought it would go viral as a meme.\\n\\nDestiny: And then like this, this, like, weird thing of like, oh, I was just trying to help people. Like, it was cringe and stupid and not true. Like, you just wanted to get paid, dog. You wanted to get paid. You got paid. Like, that's it. Just say that much like all this weird moralizing cre.\\n\\nC: As a joke, as a comedy bit. I thought that it would make people laugh.\\n\\nD: Thought.\\n\\nG: An investment is never a comedy. Like people who are trying to tie comedy to investments. It's hilarious.\\n\\nC: I didn't expect anybody to make a large investment. Why would they? I told them not to.\\n\\nG: Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nG: Let me ask you this. When were you paid the 5005 days ago? Five days ago?\\n\\nC: Less than a week.\\n\\nG: Were you paid in cash or were you paid in like crypto cash?\\n\\nC: Obviously.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nC: And you're being, as far as I know it, my understanding I hold none of this coins. I don't have any coins in my wallet. It'my understanding they set aside 2% for me, but I don't have a way to receive that.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, like that sounds really bad when you say that. So remember, okay, CEO compensation is done in stock a lot of the times because the goal is you want to tie the incentives of the CEO along with the incentives of the board. Okay. If the CEO is getting compensated in stock, then the CEO is motivated to make decisions to increase the value of the company so that the share values that the board members represent also increase your aligning incentives there. If Boogie knows, and he just said that Boogie knows, that part of his compensation is in the coin itself, he's got 2% ownership, I guess, of all the coins or some percentage of the coins, whatever. If he's got that 2%, that means that boogie has an incentive to see the price increase. And an increase in price kind of necessarily implies that a lot of people are trading on it. So that's not a good thing that, that. Hopefully we'll see if coffee picks up on that. But o good.\\n\\nC: It's my understanding they've set aside 2% for me, but I don't have a way to receive that. So I don't know what good that does mean. And 2% of nothing I thought was nothing anyway, so who.\\n\\nG: No, but now the coin is your coin that you told no when to buy is being bought, unsurprisingly, and now it is worth something. Are you think gonna sell that too? If you get a hold of it, are you going to sell it?\\n\\nC: No, I will not sell. I won't be able to get a hold of it. I don't have a wallet anymore.\\n\\nG: Well, they can just sell it for you. They can just make money for you. Are you gonna take it?\\n\\nC: If I'm being genuine with you, and I do want to be genuine.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, right. And so he even lied. I don't know if Coffeezilla realized what he was asking here, but. But I think when Boogie says he doesn't have access to it or can't do it, I think Boogie's trying to be cute because I think boogie, it sounds like Boogie knows that he's going to be compensated based on the value of that coin. Which means that first thing that I asked where I was, like when you said it was five k up front and then five k after, was that based on any performance metrics? I wonder now if in that contract that five k that he got later, if that was based on a performance metric of the coin or if that's them compensating him or buying him out, basically that 2%. And it sounds like Boogie is aware now that there might be a way for him to be compensated for the coin. But he thought he was s being cute earlier by saying, well, I don't have the wallet, so I don't know if I have access to it. Right. Yeah.\\n\\nC: If I'm being genuine with you, and I do want to be genuine with you and the rest of the Internet, I'm in pretty dire need of money. I have a lot of medical bills and I'm fighting cancer. And I very much like not to, not to, you know, fuck around with my health care too much. But that's something I would generally have to consider. And I know that from watching your videos maybe here, a lot of people are going to take that as a no and it might end up being a no. So I may as well give you a hard note here because I very, very much need the money. I'on, I'm on $1,800 for the medications right now. I need the money to pay for that. I have a $2,000 a month mortgage.\\n\\nDestiny: Does he not have like Medicaid or any kind of like state medication, like insurance program or what's.\\n\\nC: I genuinely would like very much to keep my home. I very much like. But I don't want to do it at the price of ripping anybody off. And I.\\n\\nG: That is kind of what's happened here.\\n\\nDestiny: It's not kind of what's happened a little bit. Don't say, don't soften that. That's exactly what's happened here. There is a scam that's being perpetuated with the coin that he's being paid to support and he's getting paid a percentage of how successful the scam runs. That's exactly what's happening. Lindsey, thank you for the 15 viewer host.\\n\\nC: My home very much like but I don't want to do it at the price of ripping everybody off.\\n\\nG: And that is kind of what's happened here a little bit though, you know that.\\n\\nC: Yeah, I mean, you've been foreed me of that and I'very sorry for that. I. I hope people heard what I had to say. I hope people remember like you're buying into a community that's there to make fun of me for losing my ass. That's the entire point of the community. You're supposed to, as a crypto bro, come in and maybe you throw me a bone because, you know, I have medical bills and shit to pay.\\n\\nDestiny: But wait, so people are supposed to buy into it if you're a crypto bro? So they were supposed to buy it? What does he mean you throw you a bone because you have bills to pay? So was it a joke coin from the very beginning that nobody was ever supposed to take seriously? Or was it a coin where you make fun of boogie by buying into it so he makes money, but then other people arenna be insent by spy into it or what?\\n\\nC: Like, that's for millionaires. I want multi millionaires.\\n\\nG: They're really not throwing you a bone though. They're throwing the people who paid you a bone. Like the people who are investing in this coin are enriching not you the most, but the people who paid you. And that's the whole grift. It's like people are getting celebrities to rent out their reputations to milk them.\\n\\nC: For all their worth. But you're describing I charge for memberships on YouTube. YouTube takes off. You're talking about a grift that every company does on the entire Internet. I didn't think it would.\\n\\nG: Obvious. Oh, this is a membership. This is to make money, right? That's what meme coins are about, making money.\\n\\nC: Well, I accept the fact that you're telling me I'm rving people off. And I accept that that might very well be true. And I don't mean to be. And it was not my intention. My intention.\\n\\nDestiny: He always shirks responsibility. He does this thing where he. He's very good at this. This is a super abusive man. That girl with him must be super mind fucked. I feel so bad for her. Boogie's like a master of manipulatively avoiding responsibility while sounding like he's making concessions the entire time, right? You understand that? You, you understand that you stole that homeless guy's money, you know, and now he's starving. It. It's like, I mean, yeah, if he's starving to death now, like, yeah, I mean, I accept that, that, you know, yeah, maybe. Maybe that money in that cup that was his might have actually belonged to him, but I mean, I didn't know it at the time. I've seen money laying on the ground a ton before and I've picked it up and I've seen tons of people walk by and pick up money and I spend that money on medical bills. And I mean, if you're telling me that that's really what happened, then, you know, I guess. Okay, yeah, if you're telling me then the recognition of the wrong is always external, right? You're the one that's realized I did a wrong thing. He's external, right? Oh, well, if you're saying this. Oh, well, if you're telling me that. Well, that's what people are saying, if that's what's happened and it's always a thing that is, like, happening to him and never happening because of him, right? Oh, well, these guys, I guess if this is what they did and they pumped and dumped and they did this, there's no agency ever. But he never has any agency in his life. Well, I didn't know that I did this or in the advanced because remember, he always ratchets up the assurance seeking, right? If the next level of. I don't know if he does here, but the next level of the boogie assurance seeing will be like, okay, yeah, maybe I did do this. I did, I did it. And then he catastrophize this. I'm a massive fuck up. I did it and I fucked up because I fuck everything up because I'm so worthless and I can't do this and I'm just a worthless fucking person. You're right. Is that what you wanted to hear? Ear that I'm a horrible human being, right? It's this false sense of like, taking responsibility when in reality he's just trying to like, throw himself under the bus to make the person talking to him either feel bad for him or I feel like they've accomplished their mission and then they walk away and he resets it all and yeah, he like has, like, boogie is like one of the most obvious. Like, when you watches his conversational schema, it's always like abuser or manipulator type talk, every single time. It's insane. And he sticks to it so.\\n\\nC: Well, I accept the fact that you're.\\n\\nE: Telling me the biggest question for me is boogie of what he's doing? Like, how self aware of his manipulation is he. Is he thinking ahead of time. This is what I'm gonna do. Or is it like a totally subconscious thing? It doesn't even realize.\\n\\nDestiny: It's hard since I never do any of this and I'm not a manipulator, but it is truly hard to get into the mind of a person like this. I would assume that they don't know. It's like they know that if they perform, when a baby cries, does a baby really know what they're doing? What a baby knows is that if they make noise, eventually somebody will come and take care of them. But does the baby know that they're creating an environment where the other person is so fucking irritated that it's easier to acquiesce to the needs of the child than it is to sit there and endure another minute of their screaming? I don't think the baby knows that. I think the baby just knows that if he cries, eventually somebody comes and takes care of them.\\n\\nE: I think that with manipulator like operant conditioning.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, I truly think so. Yeah. That when they've engaged in certain behaviors in the past, they tend to get rewarded for it, so they continue to do so and deploy it without thought. That's my guess, I think. Yeah.\\n\\nE: Okay.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Gota. Okay. Seven more minutes. Okay. Going through.\\n\\nC: And it was not my intention. My intention was to be a spectacle, as I've always chosen to be on YouTube, for people to look and laugh and realize that I'm the fat, dumb idiot that lost his money in crypto to drive home the point that crypto is not a smart or safe investment. You have to be very careful with your money. Said that. I've said that on the telegram. I said it on Twitter. I'll say it again here, and I genuinely not think anybody would think this.\\n\\nG: Isn'T some grand point. You're just making ten k. This is just you making ten k. I think.\\n\\nC: You can do both. I think you can make a point. Get paid to do it. I think you can do both. Do you getting paid from this video? Will you be making a point in this video?\\n\\nG: Am I going to be. Am I going to be selling a product? Am I going to be selling a crypto token?\\n\\nDestiny: No.\\n\\nC: I don't know. Will it have an advertisement? I don't know. I don't know how you run your channel these days. I't see in a while.\\n\\nG: Okay. Okay.\\n\\nC: I don't know if you're running ads on this, and I don't know if you have a sponsor, but you might.\\n\\nG: Do you think that's the same coffee.\\n\\nDestiny: Fucked up so hard. Shouldn't. Coffee shouldn't have said, am I selling a product call? You should have just said, am I scamming anybody? Am I scamming anybody? Or causingbody to lose money to a scam? That's what he should have said. He shouldn't. He gave Boogain out there and I think he realized it and he didn't correct himself. So. Okay. Yah.\\n\\nC: I don't know if you're running ads on this, and I don't know if you re a sponsor, but you might.\\n\\nG: Do you think that's the same thing as a selling a financial product?\\n\\nDestiny: I will say also for people that engage in this form of manipulation, something that they're very, very, very good at doing is they're very good at attacking you from a place of perceived vulnerability. They look like they're incredibly vulnerable and exposed. And from that position, they're able to attack you so much and you can't attack them back because it feels like really horrible to do so. Right? They're either crying, they're being emotional, they're throwing themselves under the bus. And when you've got a person like that, right, fine, I fucked up. Yeah. I'm the worst fucking person in the world. Okay, sure, fine. I mean, what do you do? Like, are you a fucking saint? Are you telling me you've never done anything like this before? Like, how does it work for you when they're already at such a low position? It feels bad. Like a human doesn't naturally want to say, like, listen, bro, hold on. What I do is nowhere near comparable to how evil, like, the shit that you've des done. It's like you fucked up, like, really hard. Like, you're doing horrible shit. Because they're always, like, working to, like, lower themselves to make them unassailable from the person they're talking through. But, okay, sorry.\\n\\nC: And I don't know if you have a sponsor, but you might.\\n\\nG: Do you think that's the same thing as selling a financial product?\\n\\nC: I thought it was going into it. I'm now beginning to believe that you're.\\n\\nG: Corin is not okay. Now that if you start to believe that I'm correct, are you willing to try to avoid the damage you might do to people by, one, not selling your tokens, and two, maybe giving back the back half of you said the first half is spin. I don't know if that's true. I'm just trusting you here, but actually giving back the five k, you're going toa be making back to the community, locking it. Making sure that people aren't going to get hurt further.\\n\\nDestiny: No, no.\\n\\nC: I'm goingna pay my medical bills next month for that last half. And I'm sorry. Anybody that's disappointed with that, I have an one one dollars medication plus hundredlars medicai I got a bunch of I'm want to buy medine with man. I fully understand that. It's a shitty thing to do. I'm a shitty person for doing it. You can have an opinion. I'm okay with it. That said about burning the coin.\\n\\nDestiny: Yep. Throwing youself of us. Yeah. I'm a shady person. I'm horrible. I understand. Right? Yeah. Something I'll have to serious the next step. Right. Because if you continue to apply pressure on a person like that then eventually that's like the next step. Right. Remember you always ratchet up the bid for assurance, right. You can keep going further. I don't know if you would in this trade or not. Like you can also keep taking that further. Right? Where it's like once you've got so low, if the person continues to lean into you it's like. Well okay, well fine. What do you want me to do? You want me to die? Do. He's kind of ready doing it with the medical Stu. Should I just kill myself? Then? What do you want me to do? Should I just be broke or poor? So now I can't afford anything? Like what would you have me do? Like I have no options. Right. Remember, it's to externalize everything. To remove all agency from yourself. Those two things are one and the same. And then to continue to fight from that position. Yeah.\\n\\nC: Better. My immediate answer is I'll need to survey the damage. I'll need to understand what people have lost. I'll need to understand how much good burning those coins will do. And if it. If it's going to make a genuine impact, I think I'd consider making the sacrifice. Yes, I think I would make the sacrifice if I thought it was going to make a genuine impact.\\n\\nG: I don't believe you. I think you're going to try to get as much money out of this as you can.\\n\\nC: Well, if it's probably the last thing I'll get to do. And I bet after this video is live, I don't think a lot of people are going to trust me. Moving forward. That might be the smart move, but I'm still going to consider. Well you.\\n\\nG: I mean you did just sell out your community and your answer bills, but look, everyone's got bills. You have medical bills. That's horrible. Obviously, you know, I wish you the best, but is there not any other way to make money than launching meme coins?\\n\\nC: Well, I'm currently selling every collectible I own to try to keep my head above water. I'm making YouTube videos as much as I can, but I make dollar 20 a YouTube video if I'm lucky.\\n\\nDestiny: Remember what he just said earlier? Right? He's scrambling. He said earlier, I sit around in my home, and I'm bored all day with nothing to do, and now he's scrambling to make videos, and he's trying to sell, you know, every single thing owns. Right? It's. How are both of these things true at the same time? Does that make any sense?\\n\\nC: Because my channel is completely demonetized. I have my podcast, and I'm working as hard at the podcast as they let me, but there's only so much we can do there, and it's bringing in $2,000 a month. So collectively, I'm bringing in about dollar five a month. Without medical bills, I need about six grs to survive. With medical bills, I need close to eight or nine. And I've run out of savings. So I'm selling everything I can to just try to keep my head about water here. And I think it might go. I know we made a big joke out of it on the documentary that I filmed last year, but the reality of it is, I'm very sick. It's very difficult to get work. I took this opportunity because I thought it was a fair one. If it's not, then I'm. Why?\\n\\nG: Okay, let me ask you this.\\n\\nDestiny: If every he'so close, we're just waiting for him to drop the. What am I supposed to do? You just want me to die, then I just can't take any opportunities. Do I need to? I'm just supposed to not be able to? Come on. That's the next. That's like the one of the final stages after that, then it's like threatening suicide, and then it's gonna be shitty suicide attempts. And then it's. While actually killing yourself is never part of this escalation of bids for assuranceuse you don't get any assurance if you're dead.\\n\\nG: So other opportunity in your life is not paying a ton of money. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a crypto token wants to pay you $10,000. You think that'suddenly gonna be a fair thing? I mean, everyone knows, like, everything's about risk reward. The shadiest peoples pay the most money why did you think that was? Oh, that's gonna be fine.\\n\\nC: Because in my experiences, a lot of these crypto bros are multi millionaires. To them, $10,000 is a blink of an eye. They could burn 10,000. I thought it was a, I thought was a joke. I thought it was a bit.\\n\\nG: The joke is they're getting rich or what?\\n\\nC: Do a bit. Do what?\\n\\nG: The joke is they're getting rich or what?\\n\\nC: I hope they're not getting rich because I sure from it. I hope nobody's losing money and I hope they're not taking, I hope nobody's taking money from this. I hope nobody loses money.\\n\\nG: Well, that's impossible when you have $3 million in trading volume. It's just impossible that no one's lost money here.\\n\\nC: As I told you, my friend, I did not expect anything like that. I certainly didn't.\\n\\nG: I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you.\\n\\nDestiny: If that's true, then why did you accept getting compensated with a percentage ev valuation of coin? That's like the killer question. I mean, there's like twelve killer questions that you can ask here, right? You thought that crypto bros were goingna the ones investing in it. Then why, if you're telling everybody that it's a broke coin and to buy, if you go broke, why would you expect crypto brose to invest in it? That doesn't make any sense. It was just a meme joke. Sell. Why are you offering a service in conjunction with the coin if you thought that it wasn't going to do anything or perform at all? Why do you have a percentage stake in the coin itself like you have? There's like, so many questions. There's like, none of it lines up.\\n\\nG: Before you made that post announcing the actual coin.\\n\\nC: I mean, you told me five minutes before I made it. Yah, I appreciate that. Thank you. Right, and I appreciate it.\\n\\nG: Okay, well, um. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. How do we stop influencers from doing this? Bugie, everyone's taking these deals. Everybody wants to get rich, and they don't care if they'fans suffer. Mean, what do you think we can do? Just tell me.\\n\\nDestiny: Hmm mmm. Okay, I'm gonna guess Boogie's gonna do two prong. Put yourself in the mind of. Put yourself in the mind of boogie. What can we do to preities in the future? Well, I don't know. People like you are really important. Coffee Zilla. It's gonna be something like that. And then the second one isnna be people like you are really important. And maybe nobody should invest in these projects. They're probably all bad. I wish I would have known that before. That's my guess. We'll see what he says. Those two. I might be off. I don't know.\\n\\nG: What can I do to educate people? Because this is like a Sisyph offician battle. Every day it's someone else selling out. What can I do? How can I educate people and someone.\\n\\nC: Give me to think about it? I'm sure'be ed a little bit, I hope, because I'm gona a pause here. That's okay. So I really want to think it through. You need to get the message out that there is no such thing as a safe promotion for this.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so that was. .2 yeah. All of them are scams. Maybe. Yeah.\\n\\nC: But there is no such thing as people not losing money. If you're. You're telling me that now and I'll never do anything like this again.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, of course. Yeah. It's always after he's reaped the rewards. This is the VoS strategy. You do a bad thing, you collect the benefits for doing the bad thing. Once the bad thing has been exposed, then you try to collect the virtue for disavowing the bad thing. Every time.\\n\\nC: Yeah, I'll do my due diligence here. I do have some integrity and I'm going to do the work that I'm made to do. But after that, I'll never do this again. Because you are telling me the only outcome is that people get ripped off. If I had that understanding going into this, I would not have done.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Okay.\\n\\nG: Thanks, boogie. I appreciate it. I hope you get better. I hope. I hope you get better with your sickness.\\n\\nC: Ander, man, you don't. People general get better. I appreciate that. Thank you.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. He doesn't have cancer. That's bullshit. He's lying about it. 1 billion%. He's lying about having cancer too. Absolutely. Unless he's linked medical documents hundred percent showing it. All right. Yeah. Thank you. Why would you say that? If you had cancer, it's cancer. You don't get better from it. That's so absolutely not fucking true. Depends on the type of cancer. It depends on the condition of the patient, depends on the healthare available to you. Depends on. Now hold on. Third one is stupid. Depends on the type of cancer, depends on the status of the patient. And it depends on how far the cancer has progressed. And then also other things like finances and medical whatever. But those three are the big ones. Why would you just say is cancer. There's no hope. That's such a stupid fucking thing to say. He no shot. He's lying. He's absolutely lying. He's absolutely lying about it. Oh. Anyway, what's up? Okay. What else do you want to say?\\n\\nE: Hey, man. All right, well, I'm glad you got a kick out of that. Algh. So the next drama, I feel a little like, I don't know, this is my internalized homophobia.\\n\\nDestiny: Fuck. Such. That's such a shitty thing to do. I hope he kills himself. What? What an unbelievable fucking. What an actual. Why the fuck would he say that at the end? That's such a disgusting fucking thing to say. It's cancer. You always die. That's not true. There are so many different types of cancer with certain screening depending on what you're at risk for. So if you're a man of a certain age, they recommend things like colonoscopies or prostate exams or whatever. If you're a woman of a certain age with a certain medical background or a history of cancer, they might recommend like mammograms or whatever. Why would he say that? This is a stupid fucking horrible thing to say. I wouldn't even care so much that he says that. But the fact that he'll say that and 'collecting money for the treatment at the same time also. So is he doing chemotherapy? You said he's paying $1,800 a month or $1,100 a month. I guess it changes all the time. What is he paying for? For cancer treatments? Is he getting medication every month or every week? Or is he doing radiation treatment? What has he said about this? Don't. Have you looked into that at all? Do you know?\\n\\nE: I don't know all the details of his cancer treatment. To be honest with you.\\n\\nDestiny: Boogie, I.\\n\\nE: Wouldn'T be surprised if he's lying, but.\\n\\nDestiny: 2988 cancer. Wait, hold on. Okay. Somebody link something. Okay. Hey. So I debated not sharing this, but I got my official ah. This is why I don't trust people like Turkey Tom, okay? Because they miss out on the value of some streamers. Boogie is. Is indeed at times quite the comedian. Boogie. What a fucking hilarious joke. Boogie joking. That he would actually withhold some piece of information that makes him look like a victim. That's one of the funniest fucking jokes I've heard of the year. We've got five months left of the air. I don't think I'll hear anything funnier than this. Somebody enters in a contender for most hilarious fucking joke of all time. Okay, sorry, hey. So I debated not. I do, in fact, have a type of blood cancer called polycythemia vera. It's extremely slow moving and many people live with it for decades. No big deal. I guess if you're going to get cancer, this is the one to get. It might lead to stroke or heart attack, but that's easily managed. It doesn't eventually lead to leukemia, but we can stay on top of that. Or it could eventually lead. Okay. And at the end of the day, I don't think you should be that worried about it. And I'm not going to be that worried about it. I'll just. Why the fuck are you even publishing this? But het, if indeed has this, he has a form of cancer that takes decades to progress. So there's never any public viewing of a symptom of cancer or chemotherapy. There's no treatment involved. So you never has to talk about a treatment or paying for it, I guess. Right? Or. He didn't mention anything. Sorry. But then hold on. But assuming all of this is true, assuming all of this is true, assuming everything here is true, and he does have this and everything he said about it is true, why the fuck did he say at the end of the coffee zillow video? You know, it's cancer. You die from it. There's nothing you can do. Why the fuck would he say that? Sorry. Okay. I'm so sorry. Move on to the next thing. Thank you, Cor. Lily.\\n\\nE: Okay, so there's this streamer named Sketch who I'm a fan of. He's kind of like part of this new wave of streamers. I know you don't care for them, like Jinxy or.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Thing. I'm supposed to go over this tomorrow on, I think, XQC come over and me and Dan and him are going over it on our show. If I go over it beforehand, they're gonna get mad as fuck at me. So can we pause this one? Or if you want, you can call in tomorrow and go over it with us. But I would say right now. Can we pause that one? Is there another drama to talk about?\\n\\nE: I mean, there's always stuff to talk.\\n\\nDestiny: Abouto thanks for the five gift membership.\\n\\nE: Hold on 1 second. That was. Those are the big two I wanted to talk about. You kind of fucked me. Talk about who the fuck is XQC? That's tomorrow. Today is today. Fuck. He has wand.\\n\\nDestiny: Ha.\\n\\nE: He's canadian. Like this. Okay, hold on. Oh, actually, I have a great one. Okay. So recently, Penguin zero. Unknowingly, at the time, falseely accused sniper wolf of striking someone's channel. And it's hitting on a lot of copyright abuse on YouTube, and, like, people impersonating youtubers to take down content. And also what it counts is actually transformative. So this is fire drama. Okay. It's not as interesting as the gay leaks, but it's almost there.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, illuminator. Thank you for the subs. Wait, you said we're penguin zero. That's Charlie, right? Mm. Accused Pokemon. I'm sorry. Accused sniper wolf of false. Okay, gotcha. Link me the. Link me.\\n\\nC: Go ahead.\\n\\nDestiny: All right.\\n\\nE: But it turned out that he was. He was wrong. So I'm gonna link you. Just keep that in mind here. I'm gonnaink you this video, and then I'm gonna link you his follow up video to all of it, basically. So you have both videos.\\n\\nDestiny: Thank God. Don't let me miss anything about this, okay?\\n\\nD: I don't know what's happened.\\n\\nDestiny: You and Tom should play quick Aram match while y'all chat. Yeah. Okay. God damn it. Somebody pointed out something the other day, and it drives insane, and I can't unsee it. Now that. Okay, to be clear, just real quick, I have no problems with Charlie. I don't think he's ever done anything, like, bad or horrible. I don't think he has any beef with me. I'm not, like, critiquing his character or anything like that. I'm notkay. I'm not saying anything, like, negatively, like, bad about him or anything else. Okay. But somebody had pointed out that, like, basically, Charlie has this way where he kind of, like, delivers things and kind of, like, a cold, you know, like, humorous, like, ironic, edgy man or whatever. But he always has literally the safest opinion on every single conceivable topic. That Charlie will never, ever step outside the ring of public opinion to critique something in, like, a way that's actually. Oh, shit. He is always, like, squarely within the center of whatever, like, the entirety of the culture is pushing towards you.\\n\\nE: Think it's possible that's how he actually feels?\\n\\nDestiny: Maybe. But, I mean, even if that's true, it's a little bit like, having, like. Yeah, I don't know. But he could always live. Ye. Okay, ready?\\n\\nE: Ready?\\n\\nD: To the YouTube ecosystem. But there are some villains that have infiltrated deep into the mainframe, spreading an infection. It's pure pandemonium and chaos. And I don't mean, like, genius villains. Like, we're not talking light Yagami here. We're talking bumbling, moron villains. Like a Saturday morning cartoon character from fairly odd parents, someone Timmy Turner do battle with. Like I'm talking about.\\n\\nDestiny: Did he say light Yagami?\\n\\nE: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, is that what they call him in Death Note? In the english version, do they call him yag? Me? Oh, okay, my bad.\\n\\nE: What are they? Wait, what are they? What are they? What do they call him in Japanese?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't watch dub shit. Sorry, my bad. Go back. Okay, my bad.\\n\\nE: Wait, no, no, no, no, no.\\n\\nD: Nar.\\n\\nE: You don't watch dub shit. For some reason, saying is wrong. So what do they call it?\\n\\nDestiny: Yagami. Yagami.\\n\\nE: So what? So what do they call it in Japan?\\n\\nDestiny: They probably call them your mom.\\n\\nE: Chungshu, maybe, something like that. What?\\n\\nD: Trigger happy with strikes all of a sudden that it's completely thrown off the balance of the entire website. And I think YouTube themselves need to take action to put a. Put the.\\n\\nDestiny: Stop.\\n\\nD: Put the kabbo on fraudulent strikes. It's just so out of hand. Like a week ago I made a video talking about how tech lead continues to be a pathetic worm squirming around, issuing false strikes to anyone that hurts his feelings. Luckily, those are now being unsuccessful because YouTube has stepped in and automatically been smiting that dog shit. In the same video, I talked about the connoisseur of cringe getting off of his throne to issue a fraudulent strike to a youtuber that made fun of him, copyright striking him over 13 seconds of his clip being played in the commentary. YouTuber jokes. I've actually got a fresh little update for you right out of the oven here. Brandan spankin New. It involves once again the sensitive cyborg, the Manny show. The Manny show acts like he's a vampire and jokes are the garlic or better yet, the wooden stake being driven into their heart. It's unbelievable just how much the Manny show hates people having an opinion of them. Like any criticism previously, the channel he struck, inguin, had over 600,000 subs. A large channel. The channel that they just now tried to strike is a channel that had 27,000 subs at the time of the strike and is a 16 year old.\\n\\nC: I had gotne warnings that the many.\\n\\nDestiny: Show was copyright striking videos criticizing him.\\n\\nG: But he would notice my channel.\\n\\nC: I mean, he has 12 million subs and is 23 years old. I'm a minor 16 with 20,000 subs.\\n\\nG: Surely he wouldn't do that to me.\\n\\nC: But he did.\\n\\nDestiny: Im so sorry. And this guy might be like the demon, whatever, but I am instantaneously siding with the. Is it Manny? Im'instantaneously siding with him because the person that's against him. Just said that he can't do this because im'm a minor. The fact that this guy just brought up his age instantly makes me sigh with the many guy literally no matter what he did. Anything. Yes, read into that as much as you want. So just know that that's my stance for the rest of the video. Okay.\\n\\nC: Received an email that the many show.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes his full name was on it which I won't show out of the respect for his privacy, but yeah, that.\\n\\nC: He had reported me.\\n\\nD: Now fortunately YouTube once again actually automatically declined this dogshit request. If you look at the request there, the many show tried to issue a strike based on 8 seconds of their video being used on this youtuber's channel. So tried once again to strike this channel but YouTube said enough is enough, no more fishy business and they decided not to do that, which is very nice. So that makes me believe that they're aware that the mani show is a bad actor who abuses the strike system on the platform. So hopefully YouTube will take action against not only the Manny show but tech lead as well. Since these are two notorious examples of blatantly abusing this system, which is a legal system. What they're doing, you can't really do. You're not really allowed to do that. So hopefully the many show will face just punishment for that as well as tech lead. But there is now a new youtuber who has entered into this equation. Here we got the big three, the Manny show, tech lead and Sniperwolf. Yep, she took her lack of talent.\\n\\nDestiny: Right to the you just as a quick to not go to. We're not gonna dive into this, but to say like the DMCA process on YouTube is a legal system is not really true. But kind of maybe, but not.\\n\\nE: What do you mean it is s not a legal system.\\n\\nDestiny: Is it not not. People think that there's like that Congress is like written or that the what, let's see what federal branch with the DM.\\n\\nE: My understanding is that the reason that all this exists in terms of the MCCA system is that Viacom sued YouTube back like over ten years ago because there was a bunch of like SpongeBob on YouTube at the time. And so YouTube was then as a result of lawsuit forced to implement a system that allowed companies to use content id and that's when that was created.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, my understand is, but the copyright.\\n\\nE: Is handled by the government now.\\n\\nDestiny: Kind of. Yeah, but what I'm saying is like the process by which somebody does like removes copyrited content from their platform. I believe platforms try to do it in an aggressive manner so that they maintain their safe harbor status, meaning that they can't be personally prosecuted for a particular thing is I think it's largely left up to you as a platform. As long as you're making good faith eff ever to remove copyrighted content, then you're fine. But it's to call like content id like a legal system.\\n\\nE: It's kind of like you are sending someone a legal notice and you take down their video though now.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, kind of, but I mean like, like would you consider a cease and desist a legal notice?\\n\\nE: Yeah. You're telling someone to shut up or you'll sue them.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but it's not like of court not involved. There's not like a standard way to like lay out a cease to des assist like or like a mandated way. It's not like an actual, the court.\\n\\nE: May not be involved yet, but like.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure, I guess it is the, the only reason why I push against, I guess you could arg thing is a.\\n\\nE: Blowo of sexual act. It's like, yes, of course it's not in the vagina, but it's about to happen.\\n\\nDestiny: It's right. The reason, the only reason why I push against it is because oftentimes people will use legal system as boast of both a bad defense and a bad offense. Somebody will say, oh, content id is the way that it is because the law demands it. That's not true. Content id is the system that YouTube is implemented because they feel like it keeps them in compliance with federal regulation. That's why they have it. But it's not necessarily mandated that that particular system works well.\\n\\nE: They feel like it protects them from federal regulations and lawsuits.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, cased are safe harbor from y.\\n\\nE: Corre from rightsholderss y.\\n\\nDestiny: But they could theoretically kind of, but it's like compliance and try to fit to safe harbor in other ways. They don't have to, they wouldn't have to use content id. They could do it in other ways. That's all.\\n\\nE: Is it not in their best interest to use content id though, just because there's so much content on YouTube? Like they have to allow some way that people can claim stuff relatively easily and if they don't do that and they have a bunch of fuck ups, then once again they can violate their safe harbor and taking to court and then they're fucked and then like, yeah, potentially y to YouTube.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but I mean theoretically they could also hire like 50,000 new employees to, to receive like content strikes and manually review all of them. Or they could remove content id and just auto remove everything that gets. Like, there's other solutions that they could have.\\n\\nE: I don't even know if 50,000 employees would do it.\\n\\nDestiny: YouTube is so, yeah, I know it could be a ton others y, but. Okay.\\n\\nE: Yeah.\\n\\nD: Okay, I'm going through the Manny show. Tech lead and Sniperwolf. Yep. She took her lack of talent right to the YouTube headquarters here to strike a channel because it hurt her feelings. So the channel that received the strike is one giant onion. This is actually a very big channel. And what the video was was one giant onion did a watching Sniper Wolf's content until I laughed challenge. And it was like a three hour video. And the joke was, she doesn't make him laugh. So it was a long video going through her content and reacting to it. Now, technically, you could argue one giant onion was in the wrong because he took 3 hours worth of her content and didn't transform it. He just sat there not giving a ton of input and definitely not laughing at it because that was the joke. Sniperwolf doesn't make anyone laugh. This was a three hour video with no one having any fun. However, Sniper Wolf doesn't own her own content either. She steals it. She doesn't have the right to that content that she's reacting to in the first place. Thus, she shouldn't be able to strike one giant onion for reacting to that content like she owns her reactions. But that's like 5% of that three hour video because she doesn't add fucking anything into the videos that she posts. It's just the uninterrupted content that she steals from others. She is thief Jack'vilms as a whole, it's fuck.\\n\\nDestiny: Fuck me. Okay? I swear to God, we're not getting into this, okay? But when you say that she can't DMC because it's not her content, and your claim there, I mean, like, the default assumption would be that it is her content because she's like, react. Well, no, no, hold on. That's not fair to say the default ass setreeir, it is her content. When you're talking about things like fair use, okay, remember, when you talk about things like fair use, fair use is like self defense, okay? Self defense does not mean that you can go around and kill people the same way that fair use doesn't mean that you can go around and take people's content. What it is is it provides a way in court to explain an action that would otherwise be illegal. But to give a compelling reason for why you didn't, why it's not breaking a purported law or regulation. Right? So when somebody says something like, oh, this is fair use, maybe, but that's a defense to use in court that's ultimately gonna be decided by a judge. Same thing with self defense, that's going toa be ultimately decided by judge jury, you don't know beforehand. So to say that like, oh, Sniper Wolf can't copyright content, copyright strike people because she doesn't own her own content, that's tenuous at best for a variety of reasons. One, maybe she would win all those lawsuits. We have no idea. Sargonav Aad won a lawsuit or at least motions before court to dismiss saying that he could retweet somebody's content and add a funny thing like a text to the a copyright violation I think you won in the United Kingdom on a suit like that. Right. So it is possible that she does own the copyright to all of that. It's also possible that people have tried to copyright striker and failed and we're just not aware of those attempts. It's also possible that she paid for the license for some of that content. We also don't know that we don't know how she acquires it. There's a huge variety of reasons why we should assume probably that she does own the copyright to the content that she has, rather than assuming she doesn't and work from there. So starting from the assumption, like, she doesn't know what any hercon, she can't her say anybody is, yeah, that's like at best a tenuous argument and at.\\n\\nE: Worst, even if different levels, she doesn't technically own the stuff she's reacting to. Could the argument not be made that she, I mean, obviously legally she has a right, but she shouldn't be claiming other people's content considering the fact that her stuff is like reacting to so much of other people's shit and like.\\n\\nDestiny: Not adding anything you can make like that. Maybe you can make that like moral argument. Sure, maybe.\\n\\nE: Yeah, I think that's more of the argument he's making. I mean, I don't think he's making the argument that like, well, but then.\\n\\nDestiny: You shouldn't invoke terms like, you shouldn't invoke legal. Just say like, bro, like, I would have a hard time copywriting somebody who was like, reacting to my content on their stream ca because like, I react to so many people's content and for me to like strike somebody y exactly like, yeah, that'd be pretty fucked. Up. But, like, I'd be within my. Probably within my legal rights to do so. And if somebody's like, desty, you shouldn't do that because you're right. Like, you don't know what. Fuck, I'm violent. Always sued me for shit the fuck you're talking about, right?\\n\\nE: Saying it's, of course you're legally within your right until it's a termbina in court. But I think that, like, in layman's terms, we can, like, clearly just like, go off of the fair uset Wikipedia and then just look at what's happening and be like, sniper Ro is doing the same fucking thing as this guy. Why is she claiming this?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, just it's important to keep the legal and the moral terms separate. Otherwise people have a very bad, people already have a dogshit understanding of copyright. So to start to confuse the terms, I think it's just dumb. Like earlier when it's like, content idea is a legal system. No, it's not. It's a system developed by YouTube to remain in compliance with the safe harbor provision of the EMCA. Content id in and of itself is not like a legally mandated system. Right. I know it sounds like I'm like, just kind of like.\\n\\nE: It sounds pedantic, I guess.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, it does. But it sure, but it is important to know the differences between these individual things, right? I would say it is. No, it is important to know that'okay. Sorry.\\n\\nE: It's important. It's definitely important to know. But I mean, it's still sending someone a legal notice. Like you're basically when you start, when you start with claiming someone or striking someone, right? You're basically saying, hey, I'm doing this to you. If this goes, like, down, you know, the steps of, like, there's like, the appeal on YouTube and there's like the dispute and all that. If it goes through all these motions, then it could lead to us being in court together. So it is, in my mind, at the very least, a predecessor to a legal process.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure, for sure. I don't think that's unfair to say, but let's say I get so many cease and desist becausee I fuck with so many people. Let's say that I create an automated form on my website and based on that cease to desist that you send, I've got an automated, like an AI thing that responds to all of those cease and desists, right. So that I can make sure that people are happy. Maybe that automated system even goes through some of my YouTube videos. It checks for views and it deletes videos that have like an under a certain amount of view. If you send me a cease and desist, my automated system will just take it off my YouTube chann because I don't wa want to fucking deal with it. I wouldn't call that system like a legal system. Nobody is s not legally mandated by anybody. It's just, it's a system that I've developed in order to remain in compliance, ideally with future civil lawsuits or to prevent me from having like, civil litigation brought against me in the future. Right, but it's not like a legal system.\\n\\nE: In the case of YouTube, the reason it exists is because of past legal action that led them to.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but there's no one. There's no guarantee that content id will protect them in the future for remaining under safe harbor. And two, there's no, there's nothing that mand like. There's plenty of. There's plenty of video hosting things on the Internet that don't use a content id system. Right. Pornhub doesn't. Twitter doesn't, Facebook doesn't. To my understanding, Instagram reels, I don't think do TikTok and Twitter does have.\\n\\nE: A content id system. I would assume Facebook does.\\n\\nDestiny: Wa.\\n\\nE: Twitter does now Borhub does. To be honest, Twitter has always said you never seen like, on a tweet, it'll be like this media is removed due to this person take down.\\n\\nDestiny: But hold on, wait, wait. What is content id in your mind?\\n\\nE: Content id is a system that allows people to take down their content off of various websites if they feel like their rights are being violated.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, sorry, let me back up. Okay. On YouTube, content id is the. I believe that's the name for the automated system that they have that automatically targets or automatically detects copyright infringing content that's been pre registered with it on YouTube. Yeah, it's that automated system. It's the content id system.\\n\\nE: Okay. Yes, yes, yes. I don't think Twitter has content.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, be clear.\\n\\nE: Okay. Like messing up the terminology here. But to be clear, like, this takedown wasn't done through content id anyway. It was a manual takedown.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. Okay. Yeah, that might be the case. In which case, he's even more wrong for using the term content id.\\n\\nE: So would you say content id is an illegal process, but like, filing a copyright strike or claim is a legal process? Is that what you would say?\\n\\nDestiny: Not, not really. I think that's kind of like the equivalent of legacy cease and assist, but like, different websites could do it in different ways and a website doesn't necessarily have to comply with it. They're just at risk of losing their safe harbor status in the future if they don't comply with too many and a case is brought before them. And eventually the federal government was like, actually, we don't think you're in compliance. You're hosting too much bullshit and you haven't made a good faith effort to adhere to these things. But yeah, but okay, sorry. U okay. 412 I'm going for the right to.\\n\\nD: That content that she's reacting to in the first place. Thus she shouldn't be able to strike one giant onion for reacting to that content like she owns her reactions. But that's like 5% of that three hour video because she doesn't add fucking anything into the videos that she posts. It's just the uninterrupted content that she steals from others. She is literally a content thief. Jaxfilms has a whole series breaking that down. I don't need to get into the nitty gritty of it, but she just copyright struck one giant onion for content she herself doesn't even actually own.\\n\\nDestiny: Today I logged ont to my YouTube.\\n\\nE: Account to change the thumbnail of one.\\n\\nDestiny: Of my videos and I was met with something very shocking.\\n\\nE: I actually have received a strike on my channel.\\n\\nDestiny: Now at first I was really confused because I haven't done anything wrong. Honestly, when I first received this. Actually, you know what? And I'm even gonna make a stronger comment about this. I bet that she did own the content, and she probably could argue that she owned at least the portion that this guy'referencing, because if it was the case that her content is so derivative, meaning not transformative, her content is so derivative that she's adding nothing of value to the content itself. Why was he copying her content instead of just the source of video that she was watching? That'd be my question. I bet it was because it was the parts that included her reactions. Probably more than any other part of the video would be my guess. It was 3 hours of her content. Oh damn. Okay. Nevermin well then I don't know what the fuck. Okay, I don't know what the reference is. Nevermin okay, watch this again. I thought, wasn't it ironic to make fun of her? Oh, ooh. Well hold on. If it was ironically done to parody or make fun of her, I think. I'm not a lawyer, so takething to say with a grain of salt, I think that the strongest protections I think you can enjoy in copyright protection is like parodying or making fun of another person. So if that's the case, he should have fought it in court. But be careful. Okay? Going back channel now, at first, I was really confused because I haven't done anything wrong. Honestly, when I first received this news.\\n\\nE: I thought maybe I got struck for.\\n\\nDestiny: One of my older, edgier videos.\\n\\nE: But upon farther inspection, it turns out.\\n\\nDestiny: That I actually received a copyright strike from Sniperwolf. She took down one of my videos.\\n\\nE: Called watching Sniperwolf until I laughed.\\n\\nDestiny: Now, this was a three hour long video.\\n\\nE: I watched most of sniper wolf'content, and.\\n\\nDestiny: The premise was, she's not funny. So I'm just gonna, like, stay there and not laugh. Pretty much.\\n\\nD: Her content would not fit under a transformative argument under any circumstances. Fucking Saul Goodman wouldn't be able to make that argument in court on her behalf, because usually she just plays the entire tik Toc that she's reacting to with no input, and then maybe afterwards says, geeez, Zoinks. Can you believe that? That's it. That's not transformative work, and it's just taking everyone else's content that she showcases and historically hasn't given credit. She doesn't compensate the creators whose work she takes.\\n\\nDestiny: So Charlie could be correct here, but my question would be, her channel is huge. Like, doesn't she print money? Isn't that channel making, like, over $10 million, like, a month? I would be surprised if there wasn't some kind of, like, legal compliance team she has, or they don't do something to proactively head off. Like if. Imagine a few, like, dmcas go through and like, take her channel. It'just like, they be disastrous. But I don't know, I'm curious what she does for her compliance there. Did XC text you to go to a soccer game? Did you say, I will go if you come on? Anything else? Omega. Lol. No. What? Who said that? He asked me if you wanted to go to some Copa America thing, and I said I would rather. I didn't say I'd rather kill myself. I said, fuck football. Smiley face.\\n\\nD: ##Es and then she has the chutzpah to strike one giant onion for reacting to her content. It's craziness that's the most. That is the epitome of hypocrisy.\\n\\nE: I have said dozens of times that.\\n\\nDestiny: I wouldn't be here today if I.\\n\\nE: Didn'T have this channel, and I seriously mean that.\\n\\nDestiny: This is my only source of income.\\n\\nE: And this is my dream job, and I love it.\\n\\nDestiny: And the community I have here is literally the only thing I have and.\\n\\nE: I just want to keep making videos on here that people enjoy watching.\\n\\nDestiny: But right now my literal job is.\\n\\nE: Being threatene by sniper wolf of all people.\\n\\nD: He's not exaggerating when he says that his job, like his whole livelihood is being threatened by sniper wolf in the strike. A strike is a huge deal. Like, it cannot be understated just how serious a strike is on.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you really think she makes 10 million a month? Yes, I think so. Right. Doesn't. Doesn't her channel do over? Is it over? A is it a. Is it a billion views a month? It's ungodly.\\n\\nE: I don't think so right now, but there was a time when she was getting an insane about. I can check her view stats.\\n\\nDestiny: See, isn't it sniperolf xxx? Fuck. What is her name?\\n\\nE: Yeah, in the past, it's. It's just. It's just sniper Wolf with three s's. You're not using social blade, are you?\\n\\nDestiny: Why? Because you use that other website now?\\n\\nE: The other websites better. Beast.\\n\\nDestiny: Is that the beast? Yeah.\\n\\nE: View stats is God w nice. You. Why?\\n\\nDestiny: Absolutely.\\n\\nE: According to this, she's gotten 114 million views in the last 28 days.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, shit. My bad. Okay, this is. I thought at some point she was doing like half a billion a month.\\n\\nE: Okay, she was at one point.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Fallen off imaginely doing 120 million views a month.\\n\\nB: Yikes.\\n\\nDestiny: Yikes. Massive.\\n\\nE: I want to blow my brains out thinking about how much money she's making right now. It's like, it's actually fucking disgusting. It's so much money. Please, can I date her? Do you think she would? What do you think are my chances?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't know. Messageer, find out. Okay, hold on.\\n\\nD: Weum me this a YouTube channel and being actually a dream job for the majority of people in the world. And as I've said hundreds of times, it boils down to getting lucky. Most of the time. It's like winning the fucking lottery, having some kind of successful online career that you can support yourself with. So when you get a strike that threatens that, that's obviously extremely scary. Especially when you're someone like one giant onion who really didn't do anything wrong. Sniperwolf should not have copyright struck him for reacting to her content, which isn't even really her content in the first place. And Sniper Wolf has been on the platform for so long now, she knows just how special it is to be a content creator and how much a strike hurts. That like the kind of toll that takes. And yet she still went through with that. That is so fucking sad. That is heartless. It just. It is heartless. It's not like she's some kind of corporate suit that doesn't really understand the YouTube ecosystem. She's been here for so long, she knows that a strike is like punching someone right in the fucking teeth. Like, it is brutal. And she still went through with it because his video hurt her feelings. I suppose. Yes, reacting to 3 hours worth of probably not the best idea, but it should have never resulted in a strike to his channel.\\n\\nDestiny: I will say you should be really careful if you're going to, like, shit on somebody. If you're go goingna shit on somebody, you better make sure you're totally within the bounds of the law, or at least whatever process exists on whatever platform you're on, because you better believe they're gonna wield whatever they can at you if they feel like you're just like, trying to fuck with them. So be like, if I wanted to fuck with Hassan, I'm not gonna do it by restreaming 3 hours of his, like, begging him to fucking DMC me.\\n\\nD: But because she is literally doing what he does, but broken up over the course of years and like six videos a week doing it, as opposed to one three hour video on content she doesn't even own, thus shouldn't even have the right to copyright strike on behalf of. It's so fucking hypocritical. It's crazy to me how all of a sudden a bunch of youtubers are starting to blatantly abuse the copyright system just in broad daylight. Now they're getting so emboldened because YouTube hasn't taken any of them to court over the abuse of their system. I really hope YouTube does step up and actually do something to punish them in a big way for this, because this can't be allowed to continue. It's ridiculous. So I wanted to talk about it a little bit. That's it. So, yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Wow. Um. Do you want to do u the next video now?\\n\\nE: Yeah. So the whole point of the next video is that basically that entire video was not true. Sniper Wolf did not claim anyone, and it was. It was all. It was all false. Someone seemingly impersonating her did it. And Charlie just didn't have the proper info. I think because of who sniper Wolf is, you know, she's seen as very uncharitable to the YouTube community. So he kind of assumed it was true because she's her. And the guy in question got claimed. He never provided the screenshot until after the situation and after the first video at least. And by that point, a much people had already thought that Leah was guilty. And it. Yeah, I was kind.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, Leah. You guys are on a first name basis now?\\n\\nE: Yeah, you know how it is. Like we go way back, just type.\\n\\nDestiny: Thing, you know, like, do you want me to.\\n\\nE: Is beautiful and my angel. What's up?\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, so should I stream this next video then or.\\n\\nE: Oh, 1000%.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, 1000%. Here we go.\\n\\nD: I've got a huge twist for you today that's going to leave you more stunned than the first time you watched fight club. Last night I posted a video going over some more fraudulent strikes, which becoming a huge issue that's plaguing the entire platform. It's an epidemic sweeping through. The first one was from the Manni show. It's their second fraudulent strike that they've issued because their feelings get hurt. This one was automatically declined, which no doubt left Manny screaming into a pillow, kicking their feet in the air, wondering why no one likes them. The second strike I covered was one that was not declined. It fully went through, and it came from Sniperwolf. Or was it, was it all just aloyoy from the deep state to have a seating out of the palm of their hands as the new world Illuminati shadow government actually worked behind the scenes to frame sniper Wolf? And she wasn't actually involved. Well, maybe not to that scale, but from all the evidence I've seen now, it actually wasn't sniper Wolfu filed that strike. And it's a very complicated mess that highlights a very, very rare problem on YouTube that I very much would like to talk about. But let's go through the entire lore real quick. So the story starts with a big YouTube channel named one giant onion talking about a strike they received in their channel. For the video they made on Sniperwolf. He posted a three hour video that was joke, but it did use all her content. Well, I don't think, like all of it. It's like he went through the entire library of Alexandria here gathering every single sniper wolf video, but it used 3 hours worth and it resulted in him getting a strike. Many months later, he went trick or treating and he got a fucking razor blade laced apple. So the strike is a huge deal. He post this video, kind of going over it and talking about the situation briefly, and the video stays up for nine days. This isn't a small, obscure channel. This is a channel with almost a million subscribers. So a lot of people make some noise about this, wondering why Sniper Wolf is bullying channels that are making fun of her, and she never responded to it or anything. I eventually caught wind of this, and I talked about it in the video I made last night about fraudulent strikes. It's the second video I made in, like, a week on it because it keeps happening. Now, after I posted that video, Sniperwolf went on Twitter to claim that she never issued that strike at all, which got me scratching at the hairs on my chiny chin chin, because it's exceptionally rare for someone to be able to successfully file a strike on behalf of someone else if they're not an agency. For all the shit that I and many others give YouTube to their automated system, when it comes to strikes, they're actually pretty decent when it comes to fucking.\\n\\nDestiny: Oooh. Okay, hold on. He just said that. I don't know how true that is. I'm gonna guess what happened. Okay, this is one day ago. I haven't seen it. Okay, now he just said it's exceptionally hard to strike people for content that's not yours. What I would be curious about is how hard. Oh, fuck. I don't know if I wanna say this, though. Well, fuck it. I guess we was gonna about to find out anyway. How hard would it be to create an account? Or not even to create an account, but to send it a DMCA, where you call yourself, like, sniper wolf with, like, two f's or something, and copyright, claim some content, or say that you were part of the content on Sniper Wolf Stream, and now you're copyright claiming his video because he's watching her video and she doesn't have the licensing either. Because technically, I think you could still get in trouble for copyright infringement if you're restreaming somebody else's content and they have purchased the rights to use something. And even if you are transformative with their content, I don't know if it would necessarily give you the rights to the underlying content. That was. I believe it to be the case that if I signed a deal. Okay, I want shaky ground here, but if the UFC gave me the rights to rebroadcast a match, depending on how they do their licensing, if I read, broadcast a match, and at the end of the match, there's a song that plays that the UFCS licensed, but they didn't make this license work for all, like, distribution platforms. Whatever. Even if I have the rights to rebroadcast the UFC, I might not have the rights to rebroadcast that song being played on content that I do have the right to rebroadcast. One example of this might be that people are allowed to stream video games. However there's like streamer friendly modes in the video games that don't let you rest cause they don't want you to restream the music from the video game. That's copyright. So I wonder if somebody just made an account claiming to either be Sniper Wolf or claiming to be the copyright owner of any of the underlying content and then they just made that account and they just dmcaid the one guy's channel because they hate him or whatever. In which case I don't think that would be that hard to do. But let's see. But I also could be totally fucking off and maybe it was a totally different way that they did it. Let's find out.\\n\\nD: Put in the wood on impersonator strikes. If someone is trying to claim your work and they're not associated with any reputable agency, or it's not actually someone associated with you, the strike is normally automatically declined. And what that means is basically what happened to hey this a load of dirty barnacles. We're not taking action, we just want to make youare aware of it. That's what happens usually when someone tries to strike while not actually being the person associated with the content. Now I can only think of two cases where an impersonator strike actually did go through and one of them was with the Destiny two community a couple years ago where a disgruntled gamer, a Destiny two enthusiast, went on this fucking rampage on YouTube striking innocent creators works and he filed all of them as if he was the official Bungie organization. He pretended to be the real Bungie which ended up being a huge reputational hit too. Bungie themselvesus people all thought it was Bungie but really it was just some goober larping. As Bungie he put on the suit and tie, tightened it up and said it's time to go to work, I'm miserable and I want to watch it all burn. So that's what he tried to do. False flagging a ton of channels. Eventually the sheriff on the block, big boy bungie themselves stepped in and fucked his face. They said cowabunng the dude and they let loose the legal dogs on him.\\n\\nDestiny: So as a quick thing when he says people, for some reason people didn't do this or he said something like that, the reason why people don't because when you fill out these forms I think you're filling them out attesting to claiming some kind of content. You are like I think that's like no it's not criminal misrepresentation but I think you are incurring civil liability there if you misrepresent yourself claiming to be somebody else to do something to another party or whatever. Like if I go and I claim like hey I'm this guy and just attesting that this is actually my business and I don't want you to do this. Well if the business finds out I'm pretty sure they can take you to civil court for especially for reputational harm, which im sure would translate to some kind of damages here if you were running around doing this. So I think thats generally why people dont do that. You can get civilly fucked.\\n\\nD: Its something that is taken very seriously when you impersonate someone and strike others. Its illegal. You cant do that which is why you dont see it very often. So the other example, by the way, was Nintendo. Its happened with Nintendo in the past as well, though I cant remember what happened to the culprit in that case. So some of you might remember from 2018, which I know is archaic at this point, thats fucking prehistoric by Internet. But in 2018, Alinity had that big meme about we should copyright PewDiepie. Should we copyright pewiepie? Whatever. Where she was going to copyright strike PewDiepie because he was insulting her and she was working with an agency called Collab DRM who does strike on behalf of creators. Fast forward to 2024. There's plenty of agencies just like collab DRM that do this that do strikes on behalf of crE.\\n\\nDestiny: I was with collab DRM.\\n\\nG: Hell yeah I was creators in order.\\n\\nD: To take down re uploads or sometimes just bully others into not talking about something they don't want posted it in the industry. So I decided to really stick my nose into this pile of dogshit and get a huge whiff of the stink here, that odorous methodist that every youtuber is familiar with the copyright strike system. I reached out to one giant onion to just send me all of the info about the strike, which he was more than willing to do. So I appreciate that. I'm not gonna post a screenshot because they're not mine to post. That's up to one giant onion. If he wants to talk deeper about it and show those, I'll just talk about what was there. So the copyright strike was filed by an individual who claims to be representing an agency, a collaborative agency that works withiper. So they were successfully able to file the strike based on the information that they are with this agency that represents Sniperwolf. Thus they have the right to enforce her copyright. This is a pretty common thing. Like I mentioned, there are tons of scumbag vermin that do this. These corporate suits that take this action, and many agencies that make this a core part of their strategy. However, what's definitely not a core part of their strategy is having the agents that are filing these takedown requests and strikes use a fucking personal Gmail account. So that's where things immediately became very clear to me that this is probably straight up horseradish. The email account was someone's personal gmail. They weren't using a company.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. So it's like, even less sophisticated. When I was searching somebody just like, claims. Like, oh, I represent her, by the way. So take down. Yeah, it's not hard to do count.\\n\\nD: It was not a professional.\\n\\nDestiny: But if you do it and get caught, you're me go fucked ma.\\n\\nD: It was just random Joe blows Gmail account that they're probably subscribed to browsers through. And that is uncommon. Typically when a strike is filed from a fucking agency, you'll see the email be from that agency. This was not the case in one giant onions strike here. I was pretty sure after looking even deeper, but I have no fucking clue what the motive would be for this. Since they didn't claim the video, they're not making the money from it. There's a scam through Spotify where some people will post audio and then copyright claim youtubers that use that audio, even though it's common. Sounds like Super Mario making a. A sound effect.\\n\\nE: Like, whoo.\\n\\nD: Something like that. Common sound effects. You'll have people on Spotify upload that audio and then claim youtubers to make the money from the videos they use, including that. Like the mot of there is clearly to make money through this scam. In this case, this fraudulent strike, this blatant abuse of the YouTube system. It seems like there's just nothing to gain. They took down the video, thus they're not making money from it. Like. Like the only thing they gain is making sniper wolf look evil. So maybe it's something personal there. I have no clue, but I reached out to Sniperwolf directly about this just to 100% confirm.\\n\\nDestiny: That's good. We probably should reach out to people before. If we're doing like, a video channel'recovering, like, a big accusation of somebody, it's probably good generalator to reach out for a comment. There's a reason why journalists tend to do this. But also keep in mind for where you attribute the like, which direction you think the malice goes. It could have been somebody DMCA to make sniper Wolf look bad. It could have also been a sniper wol fan who's dmcing the guy because he thinks the guy's trying to make sniper wolf look bad. Right. Could be either way, right?\\n\\nD: Or not.\\n\\nE: Like either way. I feel like ultimately this could have been avoided if the person in question from the beginning, it just like posted the proof that it was her, and then it would have been pretty easy to see, like, oh, it's actually not her.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, maybe.\\n\\nE: Yeah. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I think part of the problem with something like this is just like, I have somewhat sympathetic to critical here a little bit because, you know, cool guy, but I think that when you post videos on such like a short basis where you're trying to like get to the story super quicklye, you can end up posting a lot of misinformation, unfortunately, especially when you're covering someone who's like uncharitable, like sniper Rol who like, obviously everyone wants to see Sniper Rolf could shit on, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nE: Like if Charlie made a video about, you know, let's say ex hated person and he'd been wrong about them, people probably wouldn't have even calledt for an apology, like with this situation versus if he like accused ##able right of something like this and then d to apologize, he'd probably take a big reputational hit. So I think when you're like engaging in that likability game, you have to be really, really careful to get everything 1000% right or these things will start adding up and you'll look retarded in the long run. So hopefully he doesn't do that again.\\n\\nDestiny: As a real quick thing. Matt said in YouTube chat, he did. He said in the first video he reached out, but she didn't respond. So maybe may he said that?\\n\\nE: I just, well, it's like, I mean, maybe she didn't respond within 1 hour or something. I mean, how long did he wait? You know, are you supposed to wait? If you're to be clear, I like critical. I'm just saying, like, are supposed to wait like 24 to 48 hours for comment.\\n\\nDestiny: Isably give him a day, I think. Maybe. Yeah, or sometimes you'll say, well, I mean, sometimes you can publish a story quickly and say like, this is fast. So you put at the bottom, we reached out the content, or we reached out for comment, but we didn'tive a response yet or something.\\n\\nE: Maybe at the very least, I mean, he could have framed it more as an allegation until it had further confirmation.\\n\\nDestiny: True? Maybe.\\n\\nE: Yeah, I think that's probably something he'll do in the future. At least I hope, because, yeah, this is, you know, he heed it up a little bit.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Okay.\\n\\nD: Going back there, I have no clue. But I reached out to sniper Wolf directly about this just to 100% confirm whether or not this agency represents her. I also could find no official mention of this agency ever working with Sniper Wolf. So I feel like any agency that would have a creator as large as her would be plastering that all over their marketing material. So this definitely seems like someone pretending to work at that agency and then filing the strike. But I reached out directly to Sniperwolf just to 100% confirm whether or not she's associated with this group. She confirms not work with them at all and even goes as far as to mention that this group has targeted her channel in the past as well. I also asked if she'be taking any action against them for the impersonation strikes since it is illegal. And we have already seen a legal case from this with Bungie as well as YouTube themselves doing this. I mentioned this all the time. YouTube dunked on a false flagger back in like 2019. They fucking ruined them, annihilated them. It fucking eviscerated them for this kind of dog shit. So I asked if sniper Wolf be trying to take action. She talks about how they're a foreign company, so it's pretty hard. And she's right since it is. Her options are kind of limited there. So it's going to really be up to YouTube to solve this issue. Apparently this group has done this multiple times in the past and now they've just done it again. So it looks like the only option to save the day is going to be sending up the bat signal and hoping YouTube will put on the cape and shut this group down and maybe they will pursue something legally against them because this is an issue that is spiraling out of control now. Youtubers abusing the copyright system we've seen multiple times. Now tech lead and the many show as well as a couple others in the past. And now sniper Wol being framed for being one by a completely separate third party that has no association with her. That's a huge problem. If impersonator strikes are going to start to go through, that's going to lead to complete fucking pandemonium. So this needs to be stopped ASAP and this needs to be made an example out of on YouTube's end. I feel so apologies to sniper Wolf. I'm sorry for the big headache that this must have caused when she didn't do it. She wasn't the one that issued the strike, so.\\n\\nDestiny: Y. Aah.\\n\\nD: Big update to this story here and hopefully a happy ending with YouTube getting that strike taken off of one giant onions channel, as well as preventing that group from doing this kind of shit in the future. And maybe this is pie in the sky, like, maybe I'm just on the fucking crack pipe for this thought, but maybe YouTube will do even more to make strike system a lot more strict and a lot more difficult to have things like this squeak through the cracks. So I'm hoping I'm really on that fucking opium right now. That's really about it. Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Wow. Cool.\\n\\nE: Pretty amazing. Pretty shocking. Groundbreaking.\\n\\nDestiny: Pretty shockingeah.\\n\\nE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, okay, what time are you streaming with x tomorrow?\\n\\nDestiny: Theoretically at six or 07:00. We'll see if he shows up.\\n\\nE: Is he known to not show up?\\n\\nDestiny: I don't know. We'll see. Okay.\\n\\nE: How are things in a politics world lately? Any grief from Hassan? Any, anything on that end or. No. Have those guys all calmed down?\\n\\nDestiny: The twitch dudesmm pretty well right now. I've just spent. I said I was dedicating this month or just reading a bunch of shit. So we read through two supreme court cases, read through some MlK stuff. Today we're gonna be doing u other events. Yeah, just reading. Just chilling you.\\n\\nE: Nice, nice. That's good. I wonder if sneako getting unbanned, I guess. I'm very shocked that you haven't been on twitch at all.\\n\\nDestiny: I already. My appeal got rejected like a week after Sneos got approbeved. So they just super don't like me there. It's just seems like it's so like, who's the. Sorry, who's the one cod streamer?\\n\\nE: The one cod streamer. Oh, Nick Mercs.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Oh, yeah. He got banned for. For calling them trainees.\\n\\nE: Yeah. And your perma band to this day.\\n\\nDestiny: Pretty wacky.\\n\\nE: It must just be with him. He just brings them in too much money for them to ban him permanently. Now that I think he should be banned permanently. But like, just the fucking unbmanan destiny twitch. Okay, true.\\n\\nD: Yeah.\\n\\nE: Did you see the new Willie Mack show about the slasher and all that stuff?\\n\\nDestiny: No, what about it?\\n\\nE: He. He covered some. He covered it pretty well. He didn't even have proper confirmation from the beginning of what Doc had or hadn't done. And that was revealed through DM's from Slasher to Willie and wasty. It was pretty fire. If you're looking at STR, someone to watch. You should definitely watch it. It's like it's going toa twist your balls a little bit. It might change your opinion of slasher a little bit, but you'll like it.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. All right.\\n\\nE: I'm going to dm it to you and then I'm going to get out of here. All right. Thanks for chatting, love.\\n\\nDestiny: Be careful by, I need to, well, I need to listen to this, actually. First. I can still do this. Excerpt for Boy Biden welcome. Was this speech two and a half minutes? Is that in 1949, leaders of twelve.\\n\\nC: Countries, including president, came together in this very room. History was watching.\\n\\nDestiny: It had been four years since the.\\n\\nC: Surrender of the axis powers in the end of the most devastating war the world had ever, ever known. Here these twelve leaders gathered to make a sacred pledge to defend each other against aggression, provide their collective security.\\n\\nDestiny: No one cares. Okay. Hate time.\\n\\nC: Say, though, every day that I wake up is a good day. It's the one day that I don't wake up that sucks. So I've been debating for a while to talk to you guys about this, but I hope it brings you guys a little bit of clarity about some of the videos I made in the last month or so because I've been.\\n\\nDestiny: Dating or I'm debating talking to you guys about this. Wait, what did he say in that tweet? Wait, I'sorry, it's not November 15, 2022. This video was posted November 15, 2022. In the tweet, he says, I got my official diagnosis today. Then how could he have been making videos? Because of this thing or being affected by this thing in the last couple, but okay. Been over year. Can't believe it. Thanks. God's original.\\n\\nC: I often say, though, every day that I wake up is a good day. It's the one day that I don't wake up. That sucks. So I've been debating for a while to talk to you guys about this, but I hope it brings you guys a little bit of clarity about some of the videos I made in the last month or so because, well, you remember about three weeks back I said that I likely could potentially have a form of cancer. Turns out I got a rare blood cancer called polocyemia.\\n\\nDestiny: Does he, does he? Okay. When he didn't get the pronunciation from his doctor. Okay. But also two, is he gonna show like a diagnosis, like a receipt or a letter or something from a hospital or.\\n\\nC: Turns out I got a rare blood cancer, polocythemia vera, which basically makes your body produce too many red blood cells. And when I started taking that testosterone supplement seven or eight years ago, however long it's been, we knew that this was a possibility. You never think you're gonna be the guy who gets that side effect out, right? You never think it's gonna be you, but sometimes it is. Has to be somebody. But the good news is, I mean, this is a disease that takes a really long time to get you. Statistically speaking, I'll die of a blood clot or a heart attack or a stroke due to one of those blood clots. And most people, after getting diagnosed, live another 20 years. So if you're gonna get a cancer, this is the one to get. You know, me and my dark sense of humor. When my doctor told me all of this, I said, if I die of cancer, doc, instead of my morbid obesity, which I've been working so hard on for the last 30 years, I'm gonna be pissed. And, well, the good news is, which is how I was going out anyway. The scary thing about it is that it eventually can lead to some healthy conditions, some of which already have arthritis, stomach ulcers, leukemia. I could definitely develop into leukemia, but the good news is that's pretty rare, so I don't think that's going to happen. And there's tons of different ways to treat it. I mean, they can draw your blood, like when they donate blood, or taking a daily aspirin is going to help. Getting something to help reduce the itching, which has been really rough for me over the few years. Drugs that reduce the blood cell count and, you know, things along that lines'it's pretty basic, easy stuff, especially at the stage I'm at. All they really want me to do is get a sleep study done, a colonoscopy done, and start taking an aspirin. So that's pretty cool. My biggest problem is, the best thing for me to do in this situation is to lose some weight as much as I can. Me, my eating disorder, well, haven't able to make that work so far, and I don't know if I have what it takes to. To even. Even at the threat of death to overcome the seeating disorder, but, by God, let's do or die now. Pun unintended. I always wondered if I knew that the food was killing me.\\n\\nDestiny: I think it's unreasonable to expect a person to provide written evidence in a video like this. It doesn't mean it's real or not, just not really a point in either direction. And u I feel like if you are collecting money to further, a particular thing, you probably owe some evidence that the money is going towards that. And my understanding is a lot of boogies money collecting right now is oriented around the treatment of his, the variety of medical conditions. So I do think you kind of owe it, maybe not to me, some fucking random that watches this video, but at least to your fan base, you probably owe it to them that you legitimately have whatever medical conditions you're claiming or costing all this money to treat directly.\\n\\nC: Killing me, like, I've already had heart attack, I'm recovering from it, God forbid, cancer. Like, I always wondered, if I knew for sure that the food was killing me, would that be enough to get me to stop eating? I don't know. Now that I'm here, I still don't know. I guess time is gonna tell. God, I. So it really seems like all this bad stuff is happening at once right now. And I think I'm handling it pretty well. I think that's life or fate or whatever. You know, the holidays are already pretty tough for me. Then some other issues I'been going through. Now, this health issue, I think the world tests you, right? And to determine whether you're gonna put up or shut up. I'm a survivor. I've been doing this for 48 years, kicking life's ass, surviving, at the very least surviving, right? So I'm obviously gonna survive this, obviously, until I don't, but that'let's gonna take every ounce.\\n\\nDestiny: I think this is a public announcement vid. If he opens a goFundme, then of course I'd want specific details for where my donation is going. Ye, his whole streaming life is a goFundme, though, right? And why do you need to publicly announce some form of some medical condition that has almost no impact on your life whatsoever? Would you. Why do you think that? Why would you even make an announcement, like, public announcement? Guys, I have a pimple, like, behind my ear and just driving me crazy. I just want you guys to know that public and, like, the world has.\\n\\nC: To throw at me to get me there. Fuck you. And in terms of the clarity that I referred to earlier, I've known about this for a little over six weeks, that it was a probability, though. I just got my official diagnosis.\\n\\nDestiny: O, there you go. It's consistent with.\\n\\nC: I hope it gives you an idea of why I've been so worried about my money, why I've been so wored about my career, why I'been so about my future, why I've done some of the things I've done and said some of the things I've said.\\n\\nDestiny: Like, what are we talking about here? What are we saying here? Like, he's talking about how on one hand this is an irrelevant thing that doesn't really affect you that much, but then on the other hand, it's been causing me to act significantly different. There's been a significant departure from ordinary behavior in the past. What was the. What the fuck was. This is not our prognosis. In a quarter of cases, pv will progress to scarring after about 20 years. What about the average age of diagnosis for this is because the median survival for patients with it is 13.5 to 14.5 years. When do they get. Recent studies estimate the average expectnancy after dianos with to be about 20 years. The average age of death is about 77. What is the current life expectancy in the US? Life expectancy in USA for men is 76. What? Well, to be fair, this is just one thing I'm going off of for the Cleveland clinic. Okay. The important distinction would be that boogie has secondary polycythemia. Polycythemia. Polycythemianounce. This being that it's the body's normal response to. Because there's an issue with the primary formation of blood cells. This is the issue with things like acute myeloid leukemia or most of the traditional blood cancers. Oh, so this. So this particular thing is happening in response to exogenous hormone treatment, the testosterone taking. Right? Do we know that? Are we just assuming that based on what he said about the testosterone, maybe.\\n\\nC: I should have led with this before I asked people to watch my videos or become channel members or whatever. I don't know. This felt very private at the time, but it doesn't feel private anymore, so I'm sharing it. At the end of the day, this diagnosis doesn't really change much. You know, obviously we're gonna treat it. Obviously I'm gonna get the sleep study done, update my CPAP machine, get the colonoscopy done, make sure there's no other issues to worry about. I'm gonna continue to try to lose weight and continue to try to improve my brain and try to continue to work here on YouTube. And hopefully people will watch. Maybe they won't. You know, that's okay. That's okay. I'm gonna keep doing what I. I do because, you know, that's who I am. Somebody on Twitter recommended I start my bucket list. I did that back in 2017, brother. I went to Disney, I went to New York, I went to LA, I traveled the country. I spent time with friends, I met fans, I met fellow youtubers. I'got to do all the things I wanted to do right. The only thing left for me to do is get control of my eating disorder, get control of my brain, and be the healthiest I've ever been. But there's really nowhere else I need to go. Nothing else.\\n\\nDestiny: I need to think I'll ever lose weight. U at any behavioral modifications have worked so far. I don't think any. I think he did surgery and that didn't seem to work, although is it gastric bypass is what it's called. You can still regain the weight, so it seems like you probably need some kind of pharmaceutical intervention. So ozempic or saw ampphhetamine or. I think there are other things you can prescribe for weight loss and then maybe that would work. I'm not sure the I went back.\\n\\nC: Home, I saw the cool places I wanted to see. I spent time with the people I wanted to spend time with. I would like to meet more fans, I would like to meet more creators. I'd like to spend time with the fans and friends that I know. But shit, I'm I'm pretty satisfied all told. I shit, if I died tomorrow, I'd be okay with that. I got it done. I got. I got most of it done. What is left now is concentrating on healing this concentrating on healing this and using my channel to entertain, educate, and give hope to people. Like, that's all I want left in the world. And it seems doable, seems within reach, certainly within the next 20 years. I've been on the phone with friends and family all day. I've been talking to as many people as I could about this.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you think his girlfriend is real or is he just paying her to pretend she could be real? Once you re a big youtuber, you have access to a whole bunch of people that'll message you. A lot of girls will as well. And he's like, highly manipulative, psychologically abusive to say that, but he's like, highly manipulative. So I could definitely see him being able to talk to the right type of person, especially if they're young enough and not experienced with dealing with manipulative men. Yeah, I believe it. That the girl that's with him is genuinely with him, for sure, after seeing the way that he behaves, basically.\\n\\nC: And I'm very fortunate that I have phone therapy in about 15 minutes. So I'm excited to go get that done. Just processing this, and I hope I didn't put too much on you. Hope hope it doesn't. Hope it doesn't bother you that much. I hope you'll know that I'm gonna be okay. Until I'm not. And that happens to all of us. Death comes for us all. But what do we save? The God of death. Not today, motherfucker. Not today. And before I leave you, I want to make it very clear. I'm not asking for donations. I'm not asking for channel memberships. I'm not asking you to check out a sponsor. I'm not asking you to buy a shirt. In fact, I'm not even gonna put ads on this video. I don't want to monetize this in any way. I just felt you guys deserve Dino, so there you go. So I'm gonna go do therapy, sit with my dogs in my lap, talk to my friends and process this. And I hope things go well for you. There's gonna be plenty more videos to come. There's gonna be plenty more boogie in your life. Don't worry about it. As always, thanks for watching. I love you very much and I will speak with you again soon. And if you've made it all the way, the end of this video. Can I get a fuck cancer in chat? Fuck that shit.\\n\\nDestiny: U fuck, he's so gross. Fuck. This triggers the fuck out of me. So, heard penguin zero said to sort of go fund me if I need help with medical stuff. Wait, did this just get posted? Like 40 minutes ago. Do you think his entire diagnosis isn't really. What? Um. It sounds like it could be real, but it's not. Fuck me. I don't want to talk outside my. I don't know what the definition of cancer is. ##body because somebody in chat said you'Renn have primary and secondary. Is that true? I don't see anything listed about that. Any. I feel like that would have been on the first. Jesus, Nathan, chill. In secondary polycythema. Polycythemia. Let me. I need to hear this pronounced. Hold on. I'm sorry. The reason why I said I don't know how they defined cancer is because cancer people are saying mutation in cells, it causes unchecked cell division or whatever. But based on how he described this, he described it in a way that didn't sound like cancer. But if this is always cancer, then my understanding of cancer is clearly wrong, because it sounds like. It sounds like polycythemia could just be, definitionally, an overproduction of red blood cells. But it sounds like I'm going so intuitively, I don't know any of this. That's what we're l looking at now, it sounds like you can induce polycythemia by introducing something in the body that causes an overproduction of red blood cells, not due to a genetic mutation or defect or a cancer, but just due to the introduction of some exogenous thing like testosterone. That's what he mentioned. But if that's the case, then I don't know if. Would you say that he has cancer? I don't know, but that's what I'm listening for. I'm just. I want to read now because I am motivated to not like him. Hold on, I just want to hear the pronunciations. What's up, ninja nerds?\\n\\nB: In this video today, we're go goingna be talking about the approach to polycythemia.\\n\\nDestiny: Polycythemia. Okay. Secondary polycythemia from medscape. In secondary polycythemia, the number of red blood cells is increased as a result of an underlying condition. Secondary polycythemia would more accurately be called secondary erythrocytosis or erythrocythemia, as those terms specifically denote increased red blood cells. The term polycythemia, appropriately in the Christ myeloproliferative disorder called polycythemia vera, in which there are elevated levels of all three peripheral blood cell lines, RBC'white, blood cells and platelets. Okay, maybe secondary polycythemia most often develops as a response to chronic hyp. Hypoxemia, which triggers increased production of erythropoietin. Bro, can we not right now. Is there a retard version for this? Holy shit. Okay. Hypoxemia is a condition where there's abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood, specifically in arterial. I wonder if this can be caused by sleep apnea. Causes. Wait, fuck, I should just click this first thing. Or obesity. Any condition that reduces symptoms. Okay, wait. Symptoms and causes. What are the most common causes? Sleep apnea and mild lung disease can cause an nocturnal hypoxemia. I'm assuming it's hypoxemia when your blood oxygen levels drop during your sleep. Okay, he mentioned sleep apnea and he mentioned getting a sleep study. Secondary polycythemia. Wasama develops his response to some chronic hypoxemia, which triggers increased production of e by the kidneys. The most common cause of secondary polycythema include obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, hypoveentntilation syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other causes include testosterone replacement therapy. Okay. And heavy cigs. Okay. Holy shit. He's hit all the fucking darts on all the boards. Patients who have arterioialvennous or intracardiac can present with polycythemia without hypoxemia. Antrop be about secretttingating tumors cause some cases. Secondary polycythemia must be differentiated from primary polycythemia and relative polycythemia, which RBC numbers are normal, but plasant volum is contracted. The reduction in plasma volume may be due to dehydration or to reduced Vanus compliance. The lader is also some bullshit. No one. Okay, okay, wait. Okay. All this to say. Wait, hold on. Is secondary polycythemia cancer. Secondary polycythemia is not cancer, but some causes can be cancer related. Okay, hold on. I'm embarking on a whole medical bullshit. Whatever. It sounds to me like when he. When he says he has polycythemia vera, he's alluding to a type of polycythemia that can cause an elevation of red blood cells in the body. However, everything that he talks about for why this elevation is happening makes it sound not like this. It makes it sound like the secondary polycythemia, meaning it's being induced by something. So it's not cancer? That's what it sounds like to me. Does that make sense? So, for instance, when he says he has a rare form of blood cancer, he's going to point out a lot of things that can cause the secondary polycythemia, which is not cancer. Hold on. So when it says secondary polycythemia, it would be more accurately be called secondary erythrocytosis, or erythrocythemia, as those terms spec denote, increased red blood cells. So secondary, what does cythemia mean? Hold on. Let me look at this real quick. It's a word that means cells in the blood, okay? So really, the only thing that he has right now. The only thing that he has right now is lot of red blood cells. Now, there's a way to have a lot of red blood cells that's caused by a cancer. That's called polycythemia vera. But it sounds like what he just has is a lot of red blood cells because he's fat, has sleep apnea, and because he takes exogenous testosterone, it's not cancer related. Sorry. Fuck. The way he talks about somebody's drinking the fucking me. Okay, hold on. Let me re listen to this video. I'm pretty sure I'm correct. I'm sorry, one second'say.\\n\\nC: Though, every day that I wake up is a good day. It's the one day that I don't wake up. That sucks. So I've been debating for a while to talk to you guys about this, but I hope it brings you guys a little bit of clarity about some of the videos I made in the last month or so, because what you remember about three weeks back, I said that I likely could potentially.\\n\\nDestiny: Why is he taking the test again? Is it a medical reason that he said he was taking. He said that he was gonna take a sleep test. Why? My guess is to check for sleep apnea. Why? Because sleep apnea leads to a reduction of oxygen in the blood, called, which is referred to as hypoxemia. And hypoxemia that occurs over an extended period of time can lead to secondary polycythemia, more accurately referred to as erythrocytosis, which just means lots of red blood cells. So it sounds like he's getting a sleep study to see if he's having a lot of sleep apnea, which is causing a reduction of oxygen in the blood, which is leading to the increased production of red blood cells, not a cancer that's causing the increase of red blood cells. Does that make sense? So it's not a cancer that he has. It's just the fact that I'm gonna super guess here. I don't know this, but I'm probably right. My guess is going to be that when your body is enough oxygen in the blood or something, it's producing more red blood cells, because maybe that's a way that you would fight this. Maybe it thinks that you're not being oxygen for. So if it makes more red blood cells or something, it's like a way to combat that. Because maybe that's like a thing that happens. That's like a guess, I guess. But your body. My guess is something in your body has a signal that when you. The oxygen level in your blood is dropping, it produces more red blood cells. Sleep apnea is something that is inhibiting your oxygenation of your blood, not your tissue, but your blood at night, because I think tissue is hypoxia and blood is hypoxemia, I think is what it said in one of these. I forgot. But anyway, sorry, let me listen real quick. Hold on.\\n\\nC: You have a form of cancer. Turns out I got a rare blood cancer called poloccythemia vera, which basically makes your body produce too many red blood cells.\\n\\nDestiny: And so when he says this. Okay, so when he says this makes your body produce too many red blood cells, I don't think that's what's happening here. His doctor might have used the term polycythemia, but not polycythemia vera because his body muation, it's because of other conditions. And that's what he's going to bring up later in this video. Let's listen. Hold on.\\n\\nC: He read blood cells, and when he started taking that testosterone supplement seven or eight years ago, however long it's been, we knew that this was a possibility.\\n\\nDestiny: So what he just says here, it's a possibility that taking exogenous hormones, when I say exogenous, that just means hormones not coming from your body. You're getting them outside. Right? So trans people, for instance, take exogenous hormones from outside the body. Exogenous hormone. So he's getting testosterone supplements. Fuck, I need to stop closing. One of the big risks for. Oh, secondary polycythemia most often develops as a response to chronic hypoxemia, meaning reduced oxygen in blood that could be induced by sleep apnea, which triggers increased production of erythropototent by the k. I don't know the fuck is the most common causes of secondary polycythemia? Obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, hypoveentilation system, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Okay. I don't know. Bogeie says on this. Other causes include testosterone replacement therapy. And he said that his doctor warned him that TRT could cause this. But if TRT is causing it, your body is increasing the production of red blood cells in response to conditions being created by or contributed to by exogenous hormones. That's not cancer, that's just the body'making too many red blood cells because of stuff going on. Right.\\n\\nC: But body produced too many red blood cells. And when I started taking that testosterone supplement seven or eight years ago, however long it's been, we knew that this was a possibility.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah.\\n\\nC: You never think you're going toa be the guy who gets that side effect out, right? You never think's gonna be you. But sometimes it is. It has to be somebody. But the good news to get you, statistically speaking, I'll die of a blood clot or a heart attack or a stroke due to one of those blood clots.\\n\\nDestiny: And most people, why would he need TRT in the first place? I don't. I can't speak to him. But as you get older, I believe he's almost 50. Your natural testosterone can drop when you're obese. Being obese can have a negative impact on your hormormone profile, and I think it can reduce the production of testosterone. And I think other diseases can have an impact on that as well. And as your testosterone falls, it can have a whole host of other negative effects on your. Your body, like retention of fat, distribution of fat, I think overall mood, and I'm sure it affects other things that I'm not aware of as well.\\n\\nC: After getting diagnosed, live another 20 years. So if you're gon to get a cancer, this is the one to get, you know, me.\\n\\nE: Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: What you just said in DG chat, I agree with it. Sounds like what happened is that he got diagnosed with high RBC polycythemia, and he googled what it was and found out that there's a version that's cancer and then assumed it's a diagnosis of cancer. I bet that's exactly what he did. Yes, I bet that's exactly what he did.\\n\\nC: In my dark sense of humor, when my doctor told me all of this, I said, if I die of cancer, doc, instead of my morbid obesity, which I've been working so hard on for the last 30 years, I'm gonna be pissed. And the good news is it might just give me a stroke or heart attack, which is how I was going out anyway. The scary thing about it is that it eventually can lead to some health conditions.\\n\\nDestiny: So.\\n\\nC: Which already have arthritis, stomach ulcers, leukemia. It could definitely develop into leukemia, but the good news is that's pretty rare, so I don't think that's gonna happen. And there's tons of different ways to treat it. I mean.\\n\\nDestiny: If he googled this and found it out, he probably would have called his doctor, ask, wait, is this cancer? And I bet when the doctor gave him this diagnosis, I bet that the doctor said, listen, don't worry, it's not cancer. Right. I doubt the doctor would just give something like that and then leave somebody. And leave somebody in the dark about it and not say anything. Yeah.\\n\\nC: Draw your blood. Like when they donate blood or taking a daily aspirin is going to help. Getting something to help reduce the itching, which has been really rough for me over a few years. Drugs that reduce the blood cell count and, you know, things along that lines's. It's pretty basic, easy stuff, especially at the stage I'm at. All they really wanted to do is get a slee study done, a colonoscopy done, and start taking aspirin.\\n\\nDestiny: So. So, like, the sleep study done? Yeah, it's because they. It sounds like they don't think it's induced by a cancer or something, right? Oh, hold on, KkMD, you type something in chat and I love you, my dude, but it was too much for me to understand. The term polycythemia is used appropriately in the myeloproliferative disorder called polycythemia vera, in which there are elevated levels of all three peripheral blood cell lines. It sounds like very layman's being very layman's right now, but it sounds like if you have. If you actually have the. You would see an elevation in all three of these things, and it wouldn't be just because of obesity or TRT or anything like that. You would actually have a cancer that's causing unchecked cell division, and it would be showing up in all three of these levels, not just your red blood count. Sounds like. Okay. Yeah. Anyway. Okay.\\n\\nC: That's pretty cool. My biggest problem is, the best thing for me to do in this situation is to lose some weight, as much as I can mean my eating disorder. Well, haven't they able make that work so far? And I don't know if I have what it takes to. To even. Even at the threat of death to overcome the seeing soordt of by God s do or die now pun unintended. I always wondered if I knew that the food was killing me, I mean, directly killing me. Like, I've already had heart attack'recovering, from it, God forbid, cancer. Like I always wondered if. For sure.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, so it doesn't sound like I'm saying so with. So this is secondary polyytheme. Yeah. What if we look up medscape? Let's. Because I was about to say it doesn't sound like obesity can cause this, but I don't actually know that. I would just be guessing. So let's check. Hello? It's medical shit, okay? I need access to this. Don't do this to me. Don't make me have a fucking account. Just let me, please. Thank you. Okay. Polystythemia vira is a stem cell disorder characterized as a pan hyper plastic. I don't know what these words mean. Normally, I would look up every word, but I don't have time right now. Malignant and neoplastic marrow disorder. Its most prominent feature is an elevated absolute red blood cell mass because of uncontrolled red. This is accompanied by increased white blood cell, myeloid and platelet megakaryactic production. Production, sorry. Which is due to an abnormal clone of the hematopoietic stem cells with increased sensitivity to the different growth factors for maturation. Okay. Signs and symptoms of polysemia vera. Polycythemia vera. Okay, so we've got all of this shit. So these are things that impaired oxygen delivery. Probably. So this is gonna have a big overlap, probably, with basically anything that is depriving you of oxygen. Right. U diagnosis is all this shit. Management is all this bullshit. Okay. Does it say it doesn't have risk factors or causes polycythemia? Vira is caused by a genetic change mutation that develops during your lifetime. It is not an inherited genetic disorder. In most cases, it is not known why this happens. Okay, so this is for the cancerous version. It's not known why this. So when he mentions the TRT, it sounds like his doctor might have told him that this is a risk factor, but not for polycythemia vera, but for secondary polycythemia, which shouldn't really. It sounds like it shouldn't necessarily be called. That would be more accurately referred to as myelllo proliferative disorder. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I forget I just said that. That would be. That would be if you're. I'm sorry. Secondary polycythemia might be a good term. No, no, no. I'm sorry. It should be called, or this, as it would more accurately be called, secondary erythrocytosis. Okay. But the cancer form here wouldn't be caused by testosterone or obesity. The cancer would be caused by a genetic mutation. Okay, sorry. All right.\\n\\nC: The food was kill.\\n\\nDestiny: Why are so motivated to research this? I mean, I have a slight personal attachment because my kids mom had a whole thing of cancer, and that was a whole fucking thing that we had to deal with it. Its probably the closest person to me, I think, that STT with cancer. So the idea of him, like, faking cancer when he already lies and fakes so much other shit, and then hes, like, doing this, like, fuck cancer guys, blah, blah, blah. Also, John the bane. Why am I not. I'm not thinking the right name. I'm having a. Oh, total biscuit. I'read the name in chat earlier. Sorry. Total BCIT died of cancer. Yeah. And the idea that. I don't know, like, the idea, listening to him, like, woe is me about a cancer diagnosis that he doesn't have, that he's completely, utterly faking, and then he's gonna use this. It just. It bothers me. I don't like that. Fucking irritates the fuck out of me. Yeah. Sorry. Anyways, the etymology of erocyte equals red blood cell and emia in the blood. So septicemia equals bacteria in the blood. Athercyemia equals too many RBC's in the blood. Okay.\\n\\nC: Would that be enough to get me to stop eating? I don't know. Now that I'm here, I still don't know. I guess time is gonna tell.\\n\\nDestiny: Go.\\n\\nC: I fucking hope so. It really seems like all this bad stuff is happening at once right now. And I think I'm handling it pretty well. I think that's life. Or, you know, the holidays are already pretty tough for me. There's some other issues I've been going through. Now this health issue, I think the world tests you, right? And determine whether you'renna put up a. Shut up. I'm a survivor. I've been doing this for 48 years, kicking lifes ass. Surviving at the very least surviving, right. So I'm obviously gonn survive this, obviously, until I don't.\\n\\nDestiny: But that'what kind of cancers you have? It was called, I think it was called influenza type b. But the one that you actually, I don't remember at this point. It was either Hodgkin's lymphoma or non Hodgkin'lymphoma. It's the one with the really high, she had her high survivability on it. The prognosis was good, even though it was like stage four symptomatic, but it was the one that one of them is like a not great outcome and one of those a pretty great outcome. But I don't remember was it waseah.\\n\\nC: It was gonna take every ounce that the world has to throw at me to get me there. Fuck you. And in terms of the clarity that I referred to earlier, I've known about this for a little over six weeks. That it was a probability, though. I just got my official diagnosis. But I hope it gives you an idea of why I've been so worried about my money, why I've been so worried about my future, why I've done some of the things I've done and said some of the things I've said. Maybe I should have led with this before I asked people to watch my videos or become channel.\\n\\nDestiny: Are the treatments the same for the vera flavor versus not wondering if it cost thousands? Well, treating the symptoms is probably similar in that I think what he said you recommend like an aspirin and you might have to get your blood taken every now and then to drain some. However, with, if you have the. But if you've got polycythemia or if you've developed that condition or whatever that's not caused by a cancer, you can treat the underlying conditions and then you'll just get rid of it, you won't have it anymore. It sounds like polycyhemia. Lots of red blood cells isn't like a disease in it of itself. It's just saying you have a high presence of red blood cells. Now, there's a reason for this that could be cancerous, but in his case, it's not. It's due, namely, probably the obesity and the exogenous hormones. It's the fact that the sleep apnea is probably reducing his oxygen intake at night, depriving his blood of oxygen for long periods of time, which increases red blood cell production and the exogenous testosterone that he's taking. Also, I don't know why, but also seems to be a risk factor for an overproduction of red blood cell as well. Those are probably the two major causes for it, which is what he brings up over and over again without realizing it.\\n\\nC: Members or whatever. I don't know. This felt very private at the time, but it doesn't feel private anymore, so I'm sharing it. At the end of the day, this diagnosis doesn't really change much. You know, obviously, we're gonna treat it. Obviously. Inn, get the sleep study done, update my CPAP machine, get the colonoscopy done, make sure there's no other issues to worry about.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm gonna like all these things he's mentioning, the CPAP machine. CPAP is the thing that you use to unobstruct your airways while sleeping to combat sleep apnea, right. Remember, sleep apnea means your blood would be hypoxemic, or you would have hypoxemia, meaning low oxygen in your blood for extended periods of time, which is a risk factor for this. Right. All of these things that he's talking about don't have anything to do with the cancerous version.\\n\\nC: Continue to try to lose weight and continue to try to improve my brain and try to continue to work here on YouTube. And hopefully people will watch. Maybe they won't. You know, that's okay. That's okay. I'm gonna keep doing what I do because, you know, that's who I am. Somebody on Twitter recommended I start my bucket list. I did that back in 2017, brother. I went to Disney, I went to New York, I went to LA, I traveled the country, I spent time with friends. I met fans, I met fellow youtubers. I got to do all the things I wanted to do right. The only thing left for me to do is get control of my eating disorder, get control of my brain, and be the healthiest ive ve ever been. But theres really nowhere else I need to go, nothing else I need to see. I went back home, I saw the cool places I wanted to see. I spent time with the people I want to spend time with. I would like to meet more fans, I would like to meet more creators, id like to spend time with the fans and friends that I know, but shit, I'm, I'm pretty satisfied all told. I. Shit, if I died tomorrow, I'd be okay with that. I got it done. I got. I have most of it done. What is left now is concentrating on healing this concentrating on healing this and using my channel to entertain, educate, and give hope to people. Like, that's all I want left in the world. And it seems doable, seems within reach, certainly within the next 20 years. I've been on the phone with friends and family all day. I've been talking to as many people about this, and I'm very fortunate that I have phone therapy in about 15 minutes. So I'm excited to go get that done. This processing this. And I hope I didn't put too much on you. Hope. Hope it doesn't. Hope it doesn't bother you that much. I hope you'll know that I'm gonna be okay. Until I'm not. And that happens to all of us. Death comes for us all. But what do we say? The God of death. Not today, motherfucker. Not today. And before I leave you, I want to make it very clear. I'm not asking for donations, I'm not asking for channel memberships'm, not asking you to check out a sponsor, I'm not asking you to buy a shirt, in fact, I'm not even gonna pay ads on this video, I don't want to monetize this in any way, I just felt you guys deserved it up. So there you go. So I'm gonna go do therapy set with my dogs in my lap, talk to my friends and process this. And I hope things go well for you. There's gonna be plenty more videos to come, there's gonna be plenty more boogie in your life. Don't worry about it. As always, thanks for watching, I love you very much and I will speak with you again soon. And if you ve made it all the way into of this video, can I get a fuck cancer in chat? Fuck that shit.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, so he doesn't. I don't think he has cancer. Quick is to check your knowledge, bro. I dont know, fuck all apparently has a tweet addressing it. You can watch this real quick o review quiz. What can the lump formed by the production of extra cells. Be called a growth. A pimple, a wart. A tumor. Probably a tumor, right? Production of extra cells. Could it also be a growth? I mean, you need extra cells to make growths and warts and pimples, don'you. We'll say tumor. A tumor. I pretty. It'gotta be tumor, right? It's a cancer quus. A tumor that does not contain cancer cells is referred to as benign. Wait, this is like a retard quiz. Fuck you. If a tumor contains cancero cells, its malignant. Which is the following is true of cancer cells. They present a breakdown in cell communication. They ignore chemical signals and they don't die if damaged. All of these are true. Normal cells require signal molecules called blank in order to grow. Oh, this is like the grade school quizzes. Growth. Hey, sorry about my v. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Probably a growth factor. I dont t actually know the but im assuming its a growth factor. Blanks prevent cell division. Probably growth inhibitors blank regulate which genes are active in a cell. I think transcription factors relating to rna, I think determines which cell is actually like or which gene is like making proteins. I think the blank begins and ends when it divides circle of life, the cell cycle. Let's go with that. Mitosis is immediately followed by blank. When the cell grows and prepares for the next phase. Mitosis is immediately followed by gap one, synthesis gap two mitosis. What is mitosis? Immediately followed by is mitosis cell division? I don't know. I'm going to say none. That seems to like a. If we get this, if we get at least an 80% that we can declare his cancer diagnosis fake. Guys. Okay. That's what we need. Proteins that behave like the accelerator of a car and urge cells to go ahead and divide quite precisely. Are called on congees. Tumor suppressor genes on congenes, ongogenes and alleles. Proteins that behave likeor. I'm gonna guess this oncology cancer says grow. Go on con genes grow. Mayabbe. I don't know. Genes that act in a manner analogous to the brakes in a car telling called tumor suppressor. Sounds good, but I'm gonna go with that. I mean, it's right in the name. It says called tumor suppressor blank are like an accelerator stuck on. Sure. Pro row. Ooh, the fact that it's typo makes me think it might not be. Oh, hold on, wait. The typo makes me think it's probably nint. Maybe this is proteins behave like an accelerat or proto blank are like anele. Okay. And then I'm switching this. Okay. Smoking is respons possible for at least blank of all cancer death? I don't know. 40%? That'd be wild. 30? 20. 1010 is low. Let's go with 20. Here in the US, cancers related to diet have to do with eating too much red meat, too much saturated fat, too few fruits and vegetables. Can you get cancer from not eating enough fruits and vegetables? Is there? I think it's too much red meat. It's actually not all of these, but maybe it is all of these. We'll go too much for meat. Oh, fuck. Oh shit. I feel like I'm fucking up now. Oh, no. Cancers of the mouth, throat, liver, larynx and esophagus are associated with drinking hot beverages, spicy food and infam. Influenza. Weve got liver here. Lets go with drinking. As for the environment to the workplace. Scientists estimate that blank percent of all canc can be treated to air, water and our. So bro, it'a craphot. I don't know. 2% 90% of all skin cancers. Uv radiation, x ray, cell phones, television. Probably uv. Why is it logical for cancer to occur later in life? Cancer is a hibernation. No. Older people generally less healthy.\\n\\nB: No.\\n\\nDestiny: Cancer is accumulation of mutations. Maybe I and older people should die more. What is the following is not a typical cancer warning sign a lump change in bowel or bladder habits. Unusual bleeding, difficulty sleeping. Lumps are bad. Bowel and bladder habits can be bad. Bleeding is almost always bad. Difficulty sleeping, which ISG is not used to diagnose cancer. Mammograms or boob scope is to listen to your heart andd lungs. Colonoscopy can be used. CT scans. I don't know what CT stands for. Contrast? No. Cd mri?\\n\\nE: No.\\n\\nDestiny: I don't know. I dont know what to stands for. But I think they sound like. Sounds like something ive ve heard in house. Get them a ct scan. Check for the cancer. You can't check with the stethoscope, right. You can't hear a tumor moving around. I think. What form of cancer treatment is most successful before the disease is spread? Radiation. Probably to target it and blow it up. Oh, wait. Or before it'spreaded. All surgery can be really effective, right? Not chemo, not immunotherapy. Well, fuck me. Before it spread. Probably surgery, right? To remove a thing rather than doing radiation. It's got toa be surgery. It has to be surgery. I feel like. But they could say the answers is b. But if you could take out a tumor. Well, but radiation therapy is probably less invasive, actually. Right. Would you want to do surgery? If you could just do radiation therapy? Oh, fuck. Well, im'going to say radiation. Fuck me. The objective of what type of therapeut it is to kill cancer cells that could not be removed surgically. Or in some cases, to shrink a tumor. Oh, shit. Radiation therapy. Wait. To kill cancer cells that could not be removed surgically or in some cases, to shrink a tumor prior to surgery. Is chemo used to shrink tumors and then you take them out? Would you use radiation? Blaster. I feel like you could use all of these. Maybe. Who knows? Let's go with chemo. To kill cancer cells that could not be removed surgically. Orange cases. To shrink a tumor prior to surgery. Let's go with chemo. What options generally use to treat cancers that have spread from the primary tumor? Fuck. That would be chemotherapy. Right? I dont t know what the fuck. Immunotherapy. I don't know what the fuck this even means. Fuck. Well, then it can't be the same answer up here. Fuck.\\n\\nF: Wait.\\n\\nDestiny: I feel like I'm fucking all of these up. What phar of cancer treat is most successful before the disease spread'surgery? The objective of what type of surgerons to kill cancer? Cel that could not be removed surgically is radiation. This is chemo. It's probably a different one for all three. Okay. Scientists estimate that we payid more attention to cancer prevention instead of focusing mostly on treatment. At least blank times more lots can be saved. I don't know, probably 20 at least. Blank of all cancer due to preventable factors like poor diet, smoking and likeercise. Lets say 55. It'never the highest one to second. I feel like I dont want to get fucked on all the number guessing ones. Okay, good luck.\\n\\nD: 80.\\n\\nDestiny: Thats what we needed. Yes. Okay. We are now qualified to overturn his fake public diagnosis. Okay, which one did we get wrong? Mitosis is immediately followed by the answer is gap one. Okay, whatever. On code genes. Oh, shit. Because it was typo. We did get this one, bro. My test taking meta. My test taking meta is perfect. Okay? Smoking is responsibility. Least percentage. I don't know. Okay? In the United States. Oh. The answer was d. All of these. Oh, get out of here. Whatever. Okay, we'reshuffled all of these. The surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. And then we got. Okay, we got like all the number ones wrong. Fuck that. Okay. All right. Thank you, Kmd. Okay, here we go. Good luck.\\n\\nC: Hey, sorry about my voice. I'm getting over the flu, but I wanted to say thank you to the people that have reached out in the last 24 hours. Content creators, youTubers, fans, friends, even people that don't even like me have had nice things to say and I'm really grateful. Thank you.

But I wanted to say thank you to the people that have reached out in the last 24 hours. Content creators, youtubers, fans, friends, even people that don't even like me have had nice things to say and I'm really grateful. Thank you. I have. But I see the rumor mills creeping back up again. The same rumor mill that's accused me of God knows what else. And this time they've decided that I am faking my cancer diagnosis. And whereas I know that those people know better, I know that nobody's that fucking stupid, it's still going toa spread like wildfire. So number one, if you're that kind of person, fucking stop. I get it's fun to larp about me. I get it's fun to pretend that I'm a piece of shit. And I get that I made my mistakes in the past, but cancer'not? Something to pretend about. Cancer'not. Something to joke about. Cancer is not something pretending that I'm lying about cancer for clout and views.\\n\\nDestiny: He is absolutely lying. What a piece of shit. Unless he posts something in here to prove it wrong.\\n\\nC: The fucked up thing to do. Get help u secondly, if you see a youtuber saying that I'm faking the shit, link it to me.\\n\\nDestiny: He is faking. I normally free speak faking it.\\n\\nC: See?\\n\\nDestiny: Faking itds. But yep, sue me, sue me.\\n\\nC: It's time I finally foot put mye.\\n\\nDestiny: Me foot down if I have to hold on.\\n\\nC: So I will here. Okay. And thirdly, if you see the shit in comment sections, if you see videos about it, shout these motherfuckers down. Let them know. Let them know a reality. I get that it's fun to pretend. I get that it's fun to donunk go me and try it. But fuck you if you're doing that.\\n\\nDestiny: Live here right now.\\n\\nC: I don't want to let you this time. I've let you every other time. I didn't give a fuck what you had to say. But cancer is not a thing that we're gonna joke about, okay? Cancer is not a thing that we're gonna pretend I'm lying about. That's not a thing we're gonna dokay. Fucking stop.\\n\\nDestiny: I need fuck. Do I really want to do this right now? Hold on. Shit. You do anything to keep your family healthy. So isn't it time that you started thinking about your water? Oh, shit. Wor about most removed.\\n\\nB: Get clean, healthy water in your home.\\n\\nDestiny: Fuck. I don't have time. I have to leave like now. Fuck you'like this. All right, if they. If you can get me on the show, tell Keemstar to dm me on Twitter and I will get on my phone and I will be on the show. Okay? Okay. Has he ever shown proof of diagnosis? Doesn't matter. Everything that he described and everything that he said was wholly consistent with not cancer. The thing that is not cancer. He's lying. 1 million%. Fuck. How is it two years old and no, wait, has somebody made a video on this? Hold on. Boogie lying about cancer? No, Boogie does not have cancer. Boogie lied about his cancer. I am a human. What he has is something called polycythemia vera. It's a genetic blood disorder in which there is an edit. Boogie's not dying. Cancer's all blood cel. No, he doesn't have this, though. This poster doesn't know what they're talking about. It's genetic condition. What they're describing. This would be a cancer. Yeah, he's this. Fuck. They're retarded. But it's a boogie said. Okay, wait, how has nobody called him out on this? Twelve minutes ago did this guy do it?\\n\\nC: He dropped him being fat.\\n\\nDestiny: Things that he could handle and get.\\n\\nB: Rid of if he wasn't so fat.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, this guy sounds retarded, but he sounds like. I'm sorry, I just mean I'make his voice. That's so mean. I'm sorry. It's this guy sounds like he might be hitting on it. I don't have time. Listen, get me on the show. And I'll call in.\\n\\n\""
