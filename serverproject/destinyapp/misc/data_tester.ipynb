       "\"Destiny: oh hello, good morning. We'be exposing boogie. We'll see. And the Supreme Court has destroyed the entire federal government. Well, that's only slight hyperle maybe just the entire administrative state. Now you might have heard of Chevron or Chevron deference. Well, the Supreme Court just killed it. And that's a big deal. It's a huge deal. It's one of those things that generally you have to be in know to understand. But it would be like if the Supreme Court just said all briefs must be filed in Latin. Maybe it won't affect you on an everyday basis, but it really screws up the judicial system and it's going to be a pain in the ass for lawyers and judges going forward. Now, to understand this massive decision, you need a quick primer on administrative law. Here's three things you need to know. First, you know what? I'm gonna say it. No, I I'd be curious to see if this actually has that much of an effect. We'll see. Peisco said it'll have a huge effect, or seem he believes it could. Legal ego seems to be sanit s not an obvious effect. We'll see. Congress passes laws and generally courts interpret those laws because sometimes those laws are ambiguous. A lot of those laws establish or empower federal agencies because the government is big and does a lot of stuff. And finally, a ton of what those agencies do is highly technical or scientific. So sometimes Congress intentionally leaves laws ambiguous so those agencies can do their jobs. And chevron deference is all about what happens when a federal agency deals with an ambiguous law. A chaos lawyer Liz Di has more on this catastrophe.\\n\\nB: Thanks, Devin. The Supreme Court has executed its biggest power grab in decades and it'all thanks to a tiny little fish. Yes, the nation's high court issued a joint holding in two cases known as lowperbright enterprises, versus Gina Raondo, secretary of the Department of Commerce, and relentlessing fee Department of Commerce, both of which involved regulation of herring fishing in ocean waters. The ruling, which overturns a long standing principle known as chevron deference, paves the way for courts to rewrite administrative regulations. More or less it will. So now judges can overrule those pesky experts on stuff like what constitutes a distinct population segment under the Endangered Species act? When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as a biological product under the Public Health Services act? Or how much airplane noise reduction is sufficient to substantially restore the natural quiet of the Grand Canyon under the 1987 Overflights act? Those three examples come from the dissent authored by Justice Elena Kagan and joined by her fellow liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor in Ketanji Brown Jackson. As Kagan notes, the majority holding in loper bright allows courts to substitute their judgment for that of scientists and policy wonks, who certainly know more about the topic than federal judges. And that represents a massive shift of power away from the executive branch to the judiciary. It all started in 1977 when Congress amended the Clean Air act to force polluters to submit to a permitting process known as new source review every time they wanted to construct a new stationary source of pollution. Under President Jimmy Carter, the Environmental Protection Agency interpreted the law to require permits for every new smokestack. So, to be clear, Congress did its job and enacted a law, and then the executive branch implemented it through rules and regulations, which is its job. But when President Reagan was elected in 1980, his EPA took a different approach. It decided that news source review was only triggered if the improvement increased the amount of pollution in the bubble of the entire project so a factory could install a new, highly polluting modification without a permit so long as its overall emissions didnt go up, defeating the purpose of the Clean Air act amendments, which were intended to force new construction that reduced pollution overall. In 1981, the National Resources Defense Council sued the EPA in federal court in DC. That case was captioned NRDC v. Gorsuch because the nominal defendant was EPA administrator Ann M. Gorsuch, the mother of future Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. In an opinion authored by future Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the DC Circuit invalidated the rule change because it conflicted with both precedent and the stated purpose of the statute, which was to reduce pollution. The Chevron Corporation, an oil behemoth whose interest did not lie in cleaning up the environment intervened, and by the time the case landed at the Supreme Court, it had been recristened. Chevron USA vrus NRDC writing for a unanimous court, Justice John Paul Stevens reversed the DC circuit, articulating what was known for the past 40 years as the Chevron doctrine or Chevron deference. Under Chevron, courts conducted a three part test when faced with a challenge to an executive agency's interpretation of federal law. First, the courts examined the statute authorizing the agency action to see if its language was ambiguous. If there was ambiguity, it was presumed that the agency was authorized to make rules to fill any gap left implicitly or explicitly by Congress. That gap constituted an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation. Second, the court assessed whether the challenged agency interpretation was reasonable and if so, courts would defer to that interpretation, hence the name Chevron deference. Only if the agencys interpretation was unreasonable would courts rewrite agency regulations so as to make them comply with the law. Justice Stevens noted that judges are not experts in the field and are not part of either political branch of the government. When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision fairly conceptualized really centers on the wisdom of the agency's position rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, nobody cares.\\n\\nC: I'm just like a second away.\\n\\nD: I'm nervous.\\n\\nDestiny: They're gonna love you.\\n\\nD: You have nothing to worry about.\\n\\nDestiny: O'see soon. All right, who is that? Misses.\\n\\nD: I o miss.\\n\\nDestiny: Finally gonna meet the misses. It's on our way right now, so that's exciting.\\n\\nD: All right, I'm gonna grab one more picture right back.\\n\\nDestiny: Doom me ancient ear. Supreme Court justice is tierless as Gu in six months when we read more cases. Okay, yours deceive me. Or did I hear ye say the misses? The fuck? The kraken herself couldn't have picked a worthy foe. Good luck to you, lad. You'll need it. My friends are sitting here, so. 13 arms, four eyes, beak as long as a lighthouse. Iy, I know the misses. Allgh. How do d ye think I lost me eye? What? The year was 1901. I was studying me maps small when I hear is a thrash below the decck. It was the misses. So I grabbed me trusty harpoon and pierce her directly in the eye. Kn for an eye. See, that d be the code of the missus. Are you don hi let be me deo. The missus is a nickname I use for my girlfriend Ellie. It's not a squid. You wrestled a hundred years ago. So I once knew Ellie. Eddie Morris was her name. Ellie Morse. The year was 2023. We were set up by our cowork workers. Well, not exactly. Her best friend worked with my best friend. Anyway, time itself seemed to stand still. It did. Beteous. Says any siren in the seven seas. I'm sorry, are you talking about the same Elie Morris that lives on Ros and Elizabeth H. The, the art deco house with the spanish roof tiling? That be the one. Her favorite band was vampire weekend. My favorite band was Vampire Weekend. It was the perfect evening. We talked about politics, art, culture, crypto. And when I made me move, lad, she spurnned me efforts.\\n\\nB: You see, she wanted to take it slow.\\n\\nDestiny: You guys didn't fuck, did you? Utterly inseparable. We were the happiest two months of me life. We love spending time together. Her passion for pharmaceutical sales made me want to be a better seafarer. Then one day, I received a scroll that summoned me to a last minute whaling expedition in the arctic, which I knew would conflict with Ellie's karaoke party in Koreatown the following night. This party has been planned for weeks. No, I know, I know, but I'm the only sailor in Santa Monica that knows the north waters well, so I gotta go.\\n\\nC: Okay, well, then, fine. Then I'm allowed to be hurt by that.\\n\\nDestiny: It was never about the karaoke or the voyage. I was scared. You see, whenever I come close to the intimacy, I long foremost, I panic and I run. Perhaps that's why I'm drawn to the sea, to horizons I'll never cross, to expectations I'll never meet. So I start a screing y don't know what you won, ye bitch. I never loved ye anyway. So go run along to karaoke with your latin lover friends. Letin neune strike y, who art dead. I had to convince her not to love me anymore, for she deserved the world, even if I wasn't in it. Look who we found. Hi. Elijah. Oh, Elie. What are you doing here?\\n\\nC: Are you doing?\\n\\nDestiny: How are the north waters?\\n\\nD: Oh.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, they're good. They were good. Yeah, it was a very bountiful trip, actually. I'm running my own blubber export now. No way.\\n\\nC: That's, like your lifelong dream, to run.\\n\\nDestiny: Your own blubber business. Elijah, where are your manners? Ellie, how are you? How's pharmaceutical sa, it's good.\\n\\nC: It's good'm.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm just. I'm really happy for you. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, guys. They're doing, like, a half off pitchers thing next door. If you want toa head over? Y younna go head that way. Awome good to see you. Yeah, no, you. You too. Ellie, this is me ten years ago, admiring the fatty carcass of a seal I wrestled off the Costa Rodondo beach. I remember thinking to myself, I wish the whole world could see the beauty of this mammal's flesh. And that's when Elijah's blubber andorium was born. It all started here at hq, right off the coastline of Santa Monica. Now we have three locations. Fairarfax, rodeo, and now third street promenade, right by Aly. Oi. Blubber's success is thanks to cash app. With cash app, I was able to save with up to 4.5% interest on savings, allowing me to create the perfect land to sea courier route for blubber exportation. Join the millions who are already managing their money with cash app and start saving today. Make the most of your money. It pays to get paid on cash app. Wow.\\n\\nE: College protesters have finally gone home for the summer, and theyve left a lasting mark on history, their legacy. A distruptive trend in social justice activism. It goes far beyond college campuses. Its self centered, its manipulative, and its terrible for America. I call them luxury beliefs. Im the rare PhD who grew up carrying everything I owned in a trash bag, starting when I was three. I lived in ten foster homes before I joined the Air Force, and I went to Yale on the GI Bill and onto Cambridge. Along the way, I came up with the term luxury beliefs. Their ideas help by privileged to people that make them look good but actually harm the marginalized. It's like virtue signaling with consequences.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, is he the one that actually invented the term? I didn't know until halfway through our conversation with Kyla. Is it Scanton? I don't know. She said she was the one that or Scanlan? Sorry. Sorry.\\n\\nD: Fuck.\\n\\nDestiny: She's the one who made up the term vibe session. I didn't even realize that until like halfway through a conversation. Fuck. At least I think she did. I dont know why. I googled her name. I don't know what im looking for. Oh, two years ago.\\n\\nE: Defund the police.\\n\\nDestiny: Why should we defund the police?\\n\\nE: Take. Defund the police. Classic luxury belief that cause was most supported by the wealthiest Americans. It was least supported by poor Americans who are at least twice as likely to be victims of violent crime. Compared to the middle class where I grew up. We were lucky there were police to call. Next up, decriminalizing drugs. Thats another luxury belief.\\n\\nDestiny: All drugs should be decriminalized. I want to decriminalize drug possession for personal use. And heres why should crystal meth be legal? The answer is yes.\\n\\nE: That movement has been most supported by well educated Americans, less so by those without a college degree who are more likely to experience the downsides of the drug trade. My mom once tied me to a chair with a belt while she got high.\\n\\nDestiny: Hold on, hold on. Just close your eyes for a second. Does this guy almost sound like forethought? Am I crazy?\\n\\nE: Educated Americans, less so by those without a college degree who are right.\\n\\nDestiny: Holy shit. Hold on. Listen. No shot. You can't say this doesn't sound like forethought.\\n\\nE: Educated Americans less so by those without a college degree.\\n\\nDestiny: Absol fuckingutely. Absolutely. Absolutely he does.\\n\\nE: Who are more likely to experience the downsides of the drug trade?\\n\\nDestiny: Give me somebody like YouTube video of him. Forethought. Destiny. I have declared war on the destiny sub shit. Okay, so debate'making, sure the subreddit stays up. So listen to him. Listen to him. I hate I clap down on that shit. Listen to him. And my first priority is making sure.\\n\\nE: The subreddit stays up.\\n\\nDestiny: So I hate I clap down on that shit. Listen to him.\\n\\nE: By those without a college degree who are more likely to experience the downsides of the drug trade.\\n\\nDestiny: He's got like a better mic here, but come on. Okay, so to be clear, not him. Hold on. Yeah, we're talking about shared posting in the har. Okay, and so you ban those people? Yeah, this isn't a good example. Trust me, they're identical.\\n\\nE: My mom once tied me to a chair with a belt while she got high. And it's not just me. Since 2000, the number of foster kids has doubled due to parental drug use. Luxury beliefs are all over the place. Get rid of the SAT.\\n\\nDestiny: 4 hours of my life down the drain.\\n\\nE: SAT scores help underprivileged kids get into college, reject marriage.\\n\\nDestiny: I find marriage completely pointless for poor kids.\\n\\nE: One of the strongest predictors of success is having married parents. As a kid, I would have done anything to have had two stable parents. There are three golden rules of luxury beliefs. Did you notice campus protesters acting like refugees?\\n\\nDestiny: Bro, when she made that u. Oh God, what did she call it when she was speaking? Did she say, we need. It's like humanitarian aid? Is that what she said? Am I making this up? Do you? Hold on, I don't wanna mind fuck myself. Something that didn't happen. College protester. Did she say that? Whatever. Ivy Leaguer police. That would be a great first step. Why should the university be obligated to provide food to people who taken over a building? Well, first of all, we're saying that they're obligated to provide food to students who pay for a meal plan here. But you mentioned that there was a problem requ that food and water be brought in. Unless I missim to allow it to be brought in. I mean, well, I guess it's ultimately a question of what kind of community and obligation Columbia feels it has to its students. Do you want students to die of dehydration and starvation or get severely ill even if they disagree with you? If the answer is no, then you should allow basic. I mean, it's crazy to say because we're on an Ivy League campus, but this is like basic humanitarian a'asking for, like, could people please have a glass of water? They u.\\n\\nE: Luxury beliefs help many elites feel like they deserve what they have. After all, today's progressive activists are twice as likely than average to make over $100,000 a year.\\n\\nDestiny: Why are you doing this to me? What's the source on thatge?\\n\\nE: To make over $100,000 a year?\\n\\nDestiny: Why are you doing this to me?\\n\\nE: By the looks of it, you would think these protesters were facing serious consequences this morning.\\n\\nDestiny: Police say at least 45 pro palestinian protesters were arrested at Yale University. Police say they were later released. Yeah, they go into holding for like 30 minutes, and then they get tossed because nobody gives a fuck.\\n\\nE: Stakes are pretty low when you're released with no major penalties.\\n\\nDestiny: Deliver right here to the right. How am Inna get through the part.\\n\\nE: That bothers me the most, when the privileged claims to fight for the underdog, but actually hurt them instead? Remember when an heir and his fellow vigilantes faced off with a janitor at Columbia? That was luxury beliefs in action. Privileged men wrestling a blue collar worker, all in the name of the marginalized.\\n\\nDestiny: Its just scary just thinking that youre.\\n\\nE: Locked in with a bunch of crazies. Of course, not all protesters are super privileged.\\n\\nDestiny: I repeatedly said, okay, im'm sorry. His voice does not match his face at all. Right, that youe re locked in with.\\n\\nE: A bunch of crazies. Of course not all protesters are super privileged.\\n\\nDestiny: I repeatedly said that my family has been killed, and that is why I'm here.\\n\\nE: And as I was saying that through the megaphone, police officer snatched the megaphone.\\n\\nDestiny: Out from my hand and threw it behind them.\\n\\nE: And it's great that people with privilege care about injustice, but too many of these people don't know what they're protesting.\\n\\nF: Among these white woke pampered children from wealthy families. There's a complete ignorance about the complexities of this issue.\\n\\nE: Luxury belief activists turn causes into props that transfer attention to where students really want it on themselves.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you want students to die of dehydration and starvation? This is like basic humanitarian aidor asking for like, could people please have a glass water, please?\\n\\nE: Heres what protests look like without Lunx and moves. The protesters of the sixties had more skin in the game, yet almost always practiced nonviolence. Sure, no movement has been perfect, but todays students oversimplify complex geopolitical issues into narratives of good versus evil while destroying property and harassing people along the way. So how should they protest? Amplify the stories of everyone except yourself. Amplify the stories of victims. And if taking a stand means you dont get a degree or a job, dont protest the consequences. Accept them instead. When savior theater is done for the day, campus protesters have the best luxury of all, someone else cleaning up the mess.\\n\\nB: A quiet and mostly empty UCLA campus except for cleanup crews after the pre dawn crackdown.\\n\\nDestiny: Wow, late. Epic opinion piece. Also. Yes, I know Candace Owens is a Nazi. Yes, she's been doing this nazi ben for like over a year now. I think case is in this case is Germany Nazi Hitler, the greatest evil that's ever happened on earth, even though factually and statistically it is not. And part of that learning process for me when I started looking into it was coming across a huge fact. Started looking into it that we ethnically, the allies ethnically cleansed 12 million Germans. Because when you say people, okay, what is it about? I think it was like 16, wasn't it? But don't. Ok, Hitler, why is he the most evil? Well, the first thing people would say is, well, an ethnic cleansing almost took place. Now I offer it back. You mean like we actually did this? Oh wait, never mind. I'm sorry, I thought she was referring to when all the Germans got kicked out of where they had lived after world War two. She'just talking about people getting killed. So she thinks ethnic cleansing is just killing people. Or wait, death'to world war two, is she not? Yeah. Wait, actually I have no idea how many fucking german soldiers died. That number sounds high. But a lot of people died who know. Let's check why. Okay. Was almost 8 million. Damn. Damn. That's over 10% of the population. Godd damn poor Poland. That's a huge fact that we. Her career has to be spiraling. Now she's trying to lean harder into the extremist script she was doing this before. Hello. Didn't we talk about this? I feel like nobody believed me on the porn stuff when she was tweeting out things and she was like, when she was tweeting out things, she was like, who was the person that made porn popular? The United States. These are all nazi dog whistles, right? All of these are, like, common Nazi, like, oh, porn is propagated by jewish people to weaken the white man and all that. Yeah. Ethnically, the allies ethnically cleansed 12 million German. Because when you say people, okay, what is it about Hitler? Why is he the most evil? Well, the first thing people would say is, well, ethnic cleansing. How do you explain how Sneako and Hasan both are on the same side regarding Palestine? How contatulosing sides agree so hard on this? Maybe we'll get to it in a year, however long it takes us to work through all of our stuff. But the very, very, very little I understand of pre world war two Germany is that it seems similar to that and that you have a liberal world order and because things are going okay for a bit, but there's some discontent. As the discontent grows, people look at the liberal world order. They don't understand any of the good they get from it. They just have, like, complaints about some of the bad things. And then this causes people to veer off on extreme sides on both ends. In Germany, it was the communist party that I think was the KPD, and then it was also the nazi party, which was the nazi socialist party. At times they worked together, at times they fought, but both of them agreed that they wanted to get rid of, basically the liberals at the time. But I think that a lot of it stems from kind of like a discontent with the status quo, because for some reason we have a really hard time defending or justifying the status quo. I don't know why that is the case, but almost took place. And now I offer back. You mean like we actually did in this case is actually. Yeah, actually. I'm sorry. Let me realify that. That's not really fair. I shouldn't say that Germany was fine before World War Two. I don't think they were after world one. Germany was kind of fucked after world one. That's not a fair characterization of Germany. But what was the actual name of the nazi party? I have no idea. Wasn. Wasn't it just the. Wasn't it just the National Socialist Party? Was'another name? Or was it the National Socialist Workers Party, the National National Socialist German Workers Party, or the Nasdaq? Holy shit. Nice. Good clip. See Lauren freaking out about french far right communist and far leftist takeover. French government. I don't know anything about french politics. I don't know if she knows anything about french politics. I have no interest. I've only read, like, memes about it, so I don't know how true the memes are. The memes that I've read are supposedly, McCron was in a bad spot. Calling an election was suicide. And it would have, like, all but guaranteed that the far right were going to have a huge takeover in France. But he called the election anyway, and they got utterly annihilated. I don'I. Don't know enough about I don'that'like. The memes I've read. That's it. Okay, hey. All right, we've moved on from Israel, Palestine. I mean, largely. That doesn't mean that we can start posting memes of, like, european shit. I don'know. I don't know a single one of these people. I don't even wa want toa admit to the ones that I know here. Don, there has to be, like, like, a european to american ratio for memes that we're posting on the subreddit. Okay, this is just way too much, all right? There's no reason for this to be in an american. In a USA subreddit. This is absurd. Okay? Holy Christ, what is happening here? Unironically, try to name all the people that. Honestly, I think. I don't know it. This is our Boris Johnson guy. Is that Cameron? I think. Yeah. Um, I have no idea. Other than that know, I think those two. That's all I got. I don't know what any of these other fuckers look like. I don't even know if I'd recognize the names. So I heard them in the middle are the Tories. Oh, which one is Blair? Okay, it is Tony Blair. Damn. I didn't know he looked like that. Is he this guy? Damn. Why does he look so fucking mad? Because he's british. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. Somebody asked me about kids protesting Vietnam. I'mn toa be honest. My opinion on Vietnam is neutral right now. I try to have a strong opinion about anything, Elice. I wrote a lot about it because I realize how little I knew before and how little, apparently, everybody else knows sometimes. So we'll all reserve judgment was saying, but then Destiny's pretty morbid, and that's cool and all. He, like, he destroyed both my relationships. B said Stepven destroyed your relationship.\\n\\nD: Both of them.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, Stepven did or Kelly did? I thought you were blame Kelly earlier. Yeah, that was a joke. Stehven did. And that's cool because he out. He called out Sneako so many times. He embarrassed Sneako. And that's why Sneako had to dump me. Because he was so embarrassed because destiny won. And then with like Darius, like, to be honest, because I trust destiny so much. Him saying things like when he was like, oh, Darius doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. He's trying to find a way out. While now, today I realize, okay, maybe that's not true at all because he did come back to the relationship and he has done many things to try to make it work. I was problematic with like my emotions and dealing with the seeds that that like was planted in my head. Like I believed it. Like I was believing he don't love me. He doesn't care about me. Honestly, a lot. Wait, have I made this prediction yet so I can claim going back further in time? If not, then I will stake my claim right now. Zina and Darius will be back and forth for at least three more years. They will never have a healthy relationship. Though. I dont know if I stake that claim out prior to that, then extend that into the past. But that would be my guess. You said no to this girl. Mister Beast plan to save America if we lower the age to run for president, Il jump in the race. If I were president, I wouldnt care about party lines. I just always truly make the american people my number one priority for problems I'm ignorant in. I'd have experts from the left and right advise me on them and try to find the middle ground that's best for America. Wouldn't be bable don't care about doing things just because my party says I should. And I would focus on uniting the country instead of dividing it. Anyways, we can pick this up in 15 years and I'm old enough to run. He's so, so smart, so selfless. I wish we had somebody that was good enough to put the people first and not just list at their parties. True God among men. A true God among men. A time traveler tells you that when of Zena and Darius killed the other one. You have to place a bet on who killed who. What's your bet? Since Zina is the one that has the higher investment, she would be the one more likely to Killarius. That'd be my guess. But yeah, Moen is definitely, you know, taking indefinite break from coming on the stream, so. But she still will be helping behind the scenes. She says that she still wants to plan stuff. So all those big events, you know, like Wild west that we saw, you know, so all that stuff should still be there, you know, good for sad for us. Yeah, for sure. Actually. Yeah, actually, actually this is in the GM, but yeah, Malena is definitely a. Okay. Wow. I don't think. I don't think Elon Musk actually reads Twitter. I think he has a bot or someone else on the account or somebody just links him like a thing, like tweet about like. This is interesting. I don't believe he actually reads any of this shit. I don't believe it. There is something that your daddy and I. There's something that want mummy and me want to who want to talk to youuch. It's a bit serious thoughe. What's happened to my underwear?\\n\\nD: Oh, least you have no idea.\\n\\nDestiny: So sorry, but do we know each other? Yeah. No. U. Wait, Andrew Garfield is in another fucking skinwalker, is he? Oh, he's another fucking impersonator. Wait, how many of. How many of these people are there? You can't play. How can you play american military people? How can you do that? What was the name of that stupid. This has to be like everybody on set should be shaking in anger that this guy's walking around pretending to be an american soldier. Oh, wait, were these guys american in Hacksaw Ridge? I have no way. I haven't watched this movie. Ok, you're safe. Officer house is the defendant.\\n\\nD: I thought this was agreed. You wanted to enter some sort of plea.\\n\\nDestiny: Yes, sir, but I changed my mind. Just like that? You wish to proceed to a court martial? Yes, sir. Wait, is he trying to. And he's trying to sound like a southerner fucking american too. The accused as a bonger? No, sir, I don't.\\n\\nD: Why are you contesting it then? Why is it so important to you, given your refuser to.\\n\\nDestiny: Sorry. Back to this.\\n\\nD: Um.\\n\\nDestiny: I ran you over dne so. I'm Alma, by the way. Toias. We're gonna make sure you have the time of your life. Hi. Hi. Probably ought to get going. Who says bless you have shit to do then I have nothing. Whether we like it or not. Clock is ticking. What's the raush? Because I'm worried that there's a very distinct and real possibility that I am about to fall in love with you. I'm okay. It's okay, honly. It's okay not to be okay. It's a lot. Whoa, where the new stat? This is real. Show me how to love.\\n\\nD: Tell me to.\\n\\nDestiny: Ll for you. We're not interested in a treatment that accidentally wastes our time taking the ribs. Oof. Okay, now I can't watch this. It sounds like she. What? They have a kid and then she gets cancer and dies? Oo. Too sad. Okay, back to the memes. I feel like that would be excruciating painful to be in love with somebody and then you have a kid, and then that person dies and you have like, that child. I guess it's like a bright thing, but it's also like a be like a mind fuck thing at the same time. Oof. You listen. See the new towi album? Nope. Okay. Just fucked up. It not fuck up. Listen. What's fucked up? Listen, let me ask a question, Jason. Let me ask you a questionay.\\n\\nD: If you got a big ass green piece of Len is stuck in your teeth, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Is a fuck up if I tell you to go clean that up? Or should I let you, you know, walk around with it, smile around. Every chick sees a big green piece of fucking lettuce in your teeth. Is that okay?\\n\\nF: Is that fuck up?\\n\\nDestiny: No, it's not.\\n\\nD: I should tell you as your friend, right?\\n\\nDestiny: What the fuck is he talking about? Right? No, no, that made sense though. Ye yeeah. You gotta tell me. You gottaut up. You gotta tell me. Yeah, there's a letuce in Mo. That's fuck up. Okay. Is excus anything else than your supposed to be? Yeah. The twist is children are the real cancer. True. I'm impressed by your abilities and your sense of justice. If you promise not to tell anyone about this, I have important information concerning the Kira investigation that I'd like to share with you. Where's this coming from and who is he?\\n\\nB: Is it safe to just ignore him?\\n\\nDestiny: But I wonder what this information actually is. I won't tell anyone.\\n\\nD: What is it?\\n\\nDestiny: This is gonna be retarding. Kira says what? What? It was retarded. Okay.\\n\\nC: Is it true that the EPA has never obtained formal authorization legislation from Congress?\\n\\nDestiny: I'm sorry?\\n\\nC: Is it true that the EPA has never obtained formal legislation, authoritation legislation from Congress?\\n\\nDestiny: Oof. So we know. Okay. Since we've been reading Supreme Court cases and looking up stuff we don't understand, that every single agency that exists in the executive should be expressly authorized by some statute from Congress. So the idea that an executive agency exists without congressional authorization doesn't make any sense. Unless I'm missing something. So we should be able to look for. We should be able to type in founding of EPA and we should be able to get Congress authorized the creation of this office by this particular statute or whatever is what we should be able to see. So the Environmental Protect Agency is an independent agency of the United States government tasked with environmental protection. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of the EPA in 1970. Oh, but Nixon signed an executive order. Well, that's interesting. Hold on. Let's check. Do you think black bongers have less justification for the n word than black Americans? Yes. Wait, last sentence. Wait. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House center. This doesn't change it though. Reorganization plan number three of 1970 national govern. Is this all published by Nixon? Question from the president of the Congress or from the president to the Congress? Oh, okay. So he's moving a bunch of other agency functions. The goal is to move it to another agency and then reorganize it under the EPA with a broader mandate function the EPA would include. O okay, but this is essentially what we were looking for. Okay, so it was ratified by the Congress. It was just proposed by Nixon. I guess theres nothing wrong with that. The president can propose the creation of an agency, but ultimately the office has to be authorized by Congress for the establishment of the offset office. So section one establishedment the agency it was hereby established the Environment Protection Agency here and referred to as the agency. Okay, but this. And then this has to be source us code congressional administration. Okay, yeah. Okay, so he proposed the establishment of it and then. And Congress created it. Okay, yeah. Nevermin. Okay, I thought for a second there was like, did Nixon create his own office? I don't think the president can do that, but. Okay, so it. Okay, so ordinary business as usual. All right.\\n\\nC: That the EPA has never obtained formal legislation, authoritation legislation from Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, any plans for public debates with fans? I'd love to do that. To discuss climate change solutions with you. Why people like JP focuses on it like it's a devil. I don't have a huge interest in climate change right now, but we'll see.\\n\\nC: It's never been authorized by Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so it took us a little bit longer, but what she'saying. Appears to not be true because this reorganization plan right here, I'm assuming, was, I want to understand the structure of like the us code and everything better. So this is the code of federal regulations. Regulations should come from laws from statutes. U okay, so. Statement of organization journal information. So this is the creation of the EPA. The authority to create the EPA is sourced from somepl place in here. Fuck that. Pursuant to the provisions of chapter nine of title five of the United States code. The us code should represent every statute or law created and passed by Congress, I believe. Correct. The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. So no regulations, which is how the executive branch enforces law, but just the passage of law. A passage of law itself. Okay, let me just read the entire code. Yeah. Oay. So Nixon proposed an executive re organization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities, the federal government, under one agency, a new EPA. The prop included merging pollution control programs, blah, blah, from these other departments. After conducting hearings during the summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The APA was created 90 days before it had to operate and officially opened its doors on December 2, 1970. Okay. After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. If they approve the proposal, we should be able to find the establishment of the FD, or, I'm sorry, the EPA in the us code somewhere. Right. So technically, Congress authorized the office first, and Nixon just reorganized it, right? No, no, no, no. It sounds like what happened was we didn't have, like, a dedicated office for the environment, but there were a bunch of other offices that kind of were tasked with some environmental things. So, for instance, like we might, like, the interior might do, like water regulations and some other thing might do, like air pollution. But Nixon was like, we should just have. All of this should just be under one thing and it would be dedicated for the environment. And then once we have that, he made that proposal, and then Congress was like, yeah, okay, sounds like a good idea. And then Congress authorizes it. Although there also might be some special executive authority granted by Congress to create an office. If it's a reorganization of other offices, into it, maybe. Maybe the reorganization plan has three of 1970 public law and act, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the President bind, with the advice and consent of the Senate, may appoint three assistant administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency in addition to fil. Okay, so then this is them. Appro. Yeah. So this did get approval from the House and the Senate, which makes sense. I think it's supposed to. Unless there's a special carve out for reorganization. Also, generally, your officers, meaning the heads of your offices, I think, are always done with Senate approval. Unless maybe Congress explicitly says it doesn't have to be. Congress might be able to delegate that power away. But I think. I think it's ordinary that officers are always, with the advice and consent of the Senate, that the Senate has to approve, vote to approve officers also called cabinet members. I don't know why they're called cabinet members. I don't know why you wouldn't just call them officers. But was Nixon's executive order just a proposal then? No, no, I don't believe it was an executive order. I don't think so. Even though it used that language. So President Nixon proposed the establishment of the EP on July 9, and then it began operation on December 2 after Nixon signed an executive order. It sounds like he signed an order to begin the function of the. The administrator something. But he didn't create it with an executive order. He made this proposal, and then Congress approved the proposal, and then it began operating. Yeah, it sounds like that's what happened. Cabinet level officials requires Senate confirmation except for chief of staff and national security advisor. Is the chief of staff and officer, or is that just somebody to manage chief of staff? Wikipedia when I just finish the video because I just want to fuck your mom. It's got 13 seconds left. Hold on. Chief'is the chief of staff? Is that. He's not the head of any particular office, is he? I thought he just, like, helps the presidently. Shit. United States executive office of the president. Chief of staff. The highest ranking and usually highest paid legislative staffer in the office of a member of Congress. Wait, no, no, no. For the president. Congressional staff? No. Presidential staff. The presidential chief of staff of the Philippines. United States White House Chief of staff. Who joined. Who dare join my fucking.\\n\\nF: You're looking for the White House chief of staff?\\n\\nE: If you.\\n\\nF: If you google it, it'll pull it up on wiki.\\n\\nDestiny: Sorry, I can't hear you because your microphone is fucked and it's way too fucking quiet.\\n\\nF: It is the White House chief of staff. If you wiki that it'bring article and he'the.\\n\\nDestiny: Head of the executive office of the president, United States. Oh, cute. Sir, was this. Wait, was this made right at the founding or. Oh, no, this is formed in.\\n\\nF: No, this was like that in like the thirties. Yeah.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. What are your opinions on the replacing Biden thing? Do you think they should?\\n\\nF: Man, I have no attachment to the guy. And it seems like the. It seems like the evidence is mixed because there's some polls which indicate, like, people like Kamala Harris and others are in spitting distance of Biden's performance against Trump. And they lack all the advantages that Biden has, like the name recognition, the record, et cetera and so forth. But there's also a real risk that the scrutiny associated with them would drag them down. I mean, Kamala Harris has never been prot, particularly popular in the first place, and she's the only one who could get Biden's funding. So, like, the Biden Harris campaign fundraising dwarfs the DNC's fundraising. And if she's not at the top of the ticket, like, Biden dips and she's not the replacement for the presidential slot, they lose all that funding. So I don't know, man. But I'm also not the optimist. Like, Iri is still like, go Biden, go Biden, go Biden. I'm terrified.\\n\\nDestiny: Terrified. I still feel like Trump has a lot of unpopularity issues with not his core constituents.\\n\\nF: Sure.\\n\\nDestiny: I.\\n\\nF: And he hasn't really gained in that respect, according to the polls. I mean, some people say, oh, you know, after the debate, Trump's been sweeping. Well, no, Trump's level of support is basically the same. It's just that Biden is losing support and not gaining the support he needs to win.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. I also have, I have a feeling that hopefully there are still big motivators like abortion, that are working irrespective of who the candidate is. But the thing that's kind of worrying me the most right now is I don't know who's attacking Biden more right now. I can't tell because of my media, just because of, like, the bubbles that I'm in. I can't tell if it's, like, actually conservatives or'just a fuck ton of people on the left that want their own candidate in. One of the things that's driving me crazy, and I'll admit there might be Democrats that are making this, like, bow to the leader argument and I just don't see them. But watching people like Anna Kasparian and ceenk Uyghur, like, screeching over again, like, oh, we're not supposed to question authority. Ah. Like, they're screeching. And all I see when I see them say that is, like, I really want my progressive candid in. I really want my progressive candidate in. This is my moment. And, like, is anybody actually chastising people for, like, considering other candidates because they think that we should have, like, supreme deference to Biden or so?\\n\\nF: I mean, you do get some of that. There are some, like, I got my ass chewed out because I did one post mortem debate video and I began by saying that Biden had a shitty performance. And then I spent the vast majority of the video criticizing Trump because I thought that that was actually more substantive. He lied. He didn't answer questions directly. I mean, you watched the debate and I felt that it was being glossed over. But I had people in my inbox and people in my mention saying, how dare you? I mean, we got to be loyal to Biden. It's like, no, I think it's fair to call a spade a spade.\\n\\nDestiny: And, heh, I was thinking, I just mean, in terms of, like, the media, like, are there big media heads?\\n\\nF: Oah, I don't know if they'well, yeah, there are some people, like, on MSNBC, I think, like, Laurerence O'Donnell is one where he's just calmly criticizing democrats for the infighting. But for the most part, I mean, it's everywhere. I mean, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, the so called liberal media. I mean, there's, there's a lot of, like, debate, public debate. This, the story will not end.\\n\\nDestiny: Yah.\\n\\nF: I will say, though, the, it's actually a lot of the progressives, believe it or not, have Biden's back. Bernie Sanders, AOC, Elan Omar, they have all publicly said that they back Biden and that Biden's their guy. And a lot of the calls among sitting members of Congress are actually coming from the more moderate members who are asking him to withdraw or proposing that he withdraw because they're worried that he's not only going to lose against Trump, but that he's going to be a drag on the down ballot races. So, surprisingly, from what I've seen, the progressives who have rallied behind Biden more than the moderates, how's that for surprise?\\n\\nDestiny: Well, I mean, the progressives have chilled a lot. I mean, I think that most of the online progressives don't even like those progressives anymore.\\n\\nF: Like, fuck no.\\n\\nDestiny: Especially after a lot of the Israel stuff. Yeah. When AOC started tweeting about antise semitism, they were losing their fucking minds, huh?\\n\\nF: Yeah. And, and ona Kasparian, I mean, I'm not a big fan of hers anyway, because she was, she wasn't gonna vote for Biden the first place. She, if you actually watch the Young Turks content at all, they are more critical of the Democrats.\\n\\nDestiny: Even that 1 million% bro over the Israel Palestine stuff. And I couldn't get Jenk to admit it. I wish I had a, but I'm almost positive I've watched both of them talk about how they couldn't ever bring themselves to vote for, like, a genocide supporter or genocide Joe, I think I've seen Emma Viland call him, like, I don't think these people were evering for voting for Biden ever, but, well, Anna.\\n\\nF: Definitely cenk may or may not have come out and said it, but I've seen clips where Anna said, you know, and this was months ago, that she wasn't going to vote for Biden. I mean, she also bitches about Democrats when in my opinion, she really has no merit to do so. So, like right now, for example, Republicans are in control of the House. So Democrats, and this is just simply the case, they do not have the power to even bring forth legislation. You know, so she was complaining, whyire House Democrats, why are they spending so much time dunking on Republicans in these hearings? Why aren't they bringing forth legislation that the american people want? It's like they don't have the number. They can't even bring it to the floor. They, you know, you've covered this too. Like the Senate majority leader in the Senate, that's the person responsible for calling forth legislation and hearings.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, and no one even gives a fuck, by the way, just to be clear, right? Because I'm pretty sure that in Pelosi's congress two sessions ago, I think they passed more legislation on the floor than any, than any Congress history of all. But who the fuck cared? Nobody talks about that. Nobody cares because obviously the Senate wasn't hearing Anyd. So, yeah, I don't know.\\n\\nF: Right. Well, and also, I mean, this is the least productive iteration of Congress since Republicans took over because even previously, like, previous iterations of divided government, they were more willing to work with each other. But the republican majority in the House, they look at, any bipartisan bill is basically a win for Biden, including, like, keeping the government funded, right? Like, keeping the lights on is seen as a victory for Biden. So it is the least productive iteration of Congress, I think, in recorded history and certainly since the Great Depression. But Ana's, like, her criticisms are just wildly off base because, like, the video was about Republicans were proposing bills to rename Dulles airport in DC after Trump and like, like the Gulf of Mexico after Trump too, like, like the near continental waters. And so Democrats proposed another piece of legislation, obviously, again, it didn't go to the floor, but they were like, hey, how about we rename a Florida penitentiary after Trump instead? Because that's where he'll go after his cases. And she was like, I can't believe the Democrats are making a mockery of all this. They should be actually working productively for the american people. It like, you have no idea how government functions. And she's a political commentator, right? You would think that she would understand the shit. So I don't know, man, what are your prior to this? I thought you were betting on Biden still winning. Has the debate in the fallout changed your views on this?\\n\\nDestiny: No, I still give Biden an edge. It's smaller now, though. Like 55% of my brain on it. But the, there just has to be another news story that was to come up somehow. We went from other stuff. No, this whole media cycle has been so boring the past six months. I feel like it's been little bits of Ukraine. The majority has been Israel, Palestine, and then whatever random, like, domestic thing comes up for like two days.\\n\\nF: Yeah. So with, about the economy, you know.\\n\\nDestiny: Obviously I just lost all hope for Americans having any. I think that how good the economy is doing is just a function of who's in office and what media you listen to. I think it's about that.\\n\\nF: Oh, no, 100%. I mean, I mean, there's, there's an economist by the name Paul Krugman. He's talked about this. He's not the only one. But like, there is a, there is a partisanship associated with, like, perceptions of the economy. And Democrats do it too. I'm not go goingn say'they do do it too.\\n\\nDestiny: But the you go for.\\n\\nF: But it is.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, conservatives are wild. It's h hilarious how different that economy looks as soon as there's a conservative in office.\\n\\nF: Fuck. So do you bet? Assuming that things trend exactly the way they have been, that if Trump wins the election, like 20 days after he's inaugurated, those same, you know, conservatives bitching about the economy, if nothing else changes, it's just the trends going as they are. We will ll suddenly say that Trump has, like, you know, pulled us from the precipice of an economic disaster.\\n\\nDestiny: Am I making this up? I thought I saw conservative, or maybe it was Trump himself saying that the reason why the economy was starting to recover under Biden is because companies were assuming that Trump was going to win the next election. Did Trump say that or did, was there a comment? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no, so both.\\n\\nF: So you had Larry Kudlow, who was an ex financial advisor in the Trump administration. He's now Fox News host. He was also trying to give credence to this. But I think it was, it was a couple of months ago after the stock market, it was either the S and P 500 or the Nasdaq or the Dow. One of them like, blew up. Like it was, it was an unprecedented end of day closing or whatever. And Trump was all over social media. He's like, the stock market is doing well because they know that I'll be elected in November. And you had some people on Fox and who was kind of suggesting the same thing. It's stupid. You also have him trying to take credit for the jobs too. Like, he's like, this is all the bounce back effect. But I mean, even if you control for Covid, Steve Ratner and a bunch of other economists and financial adv advisors and analysts have like, covered this. Like, even if you control for Covid job loss under Trump and Covid job recovery under Biden, the average number of jobs created under Biden per month is like 280,000 compared to like 180,000 under Trump. So Biden's record is still better? Yeah, to your point. I mean, I don't, I don't know. I think it's vibes. Now. I'm like, will Stansl pilled on this? I think that it's all about vibes. But what I was going to say was the chairman of the Fed is hinting that there actually may be interest rates cuts this year. Like they hinted at it last year, and then they kind of took it off the table.\\n\\nDestiny: No, I don't think so, but we'll see.\\n\\nF: You don't think so?\\n\\nDestiny: The problem is that the cumulative inflation has been so high that even if the rates have fallen, remember when we talk about inflation, it's just a rate of change, right? Right. So if inflation was like 15% for a year, and then next year it goes down to 1%, like people often say, like, oh, look, we've fixed inflation, but they're talking about the rate of change of the inflation. You still have that 15% inflation. The total, the cumulative inflation is still something you're dealing with. So the idea that as soon as we get inflation down to like 2%, that the Fed is just going toa start slashing rates again, it seems really dumb to me, especially when your unemployment is still so low as well. It's not like we've got increased unemployment and we need to start pumping money into the economy. I would hope that they would keep rates high, but fuck. The problem is, like, Americans coming, like, economically stupid. So the issue is that, like, people want everything at the same time. So people will complain. So like, for instance, people complain about Americans. Probably everybody in the world complain about issues that push in both directions in contrary way. So Americans will say things like, housing is unaffordable and we need to lower rates. Understanding that like, or not understanding that, like, okay, well, upward interest rates should be putting downward pressure on housing prices. If you want to drop interest rates again, to make, quote, unquote, homes affordable, it's going to put upward pressure on home prices. So a decrease in interest rate should theoretically increase housing prices. Same thing with, like, student loan debt forgiveness, right? I can't afford a home. I need to get rid of my debt. It's like, okay, well, if you get rid of all student loan debt, that's way more upward pressure on housing prices. But people seem to want all of it at the same time. Andeah, it's just not possible. Yeah.\\n\\nF: Yeah. I mean, Powell didn't come out and explicitly confirm it. This is just like people interpreting, reading the tea leaves based on congressional testimony he offered, like, I think it was yesterday of the day before, talking about how it's not just. What do he say? Something like.\\n\\nDestiny: That.\\n\\nF: There was considerable progress and elevated inflation isn't the only concern that they have at this point. They're worried about the unemployment rate increasing, even though it is relatively low, I think. Still, like, 4.1%. I'll send you the link somewhere.\\n\\nDestiny: It was sub four for a while. Unemployment rate?\\n\\nF: Yeah, I think it ticked up in July to 4.1, which is still.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, I think theoretically it's supposed to be between five to 5.5. I think it's what the fed shoots for. Mm. But. Okay. Damn.\\n\\nF: As far as all this stuff, I sent you a link. I don't know if you had a chance to take a look at it, but I thought you said a couple of days ago you're looking for, like, a legal eagle thing on chevro. He dropped one.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, o did. Okay.\\n\\nF: Okay, cool. All right, buddy, listen, you have a great rest of your day.\\n\\nDestiny: I love you. Be careful.\\n\\nF: Love you too.\\n\\nDestiny: Bye. Peaceco. Oh, we came here just to mute his microphone and taunt us. Russell Brand is such a fucking mom. Yeah, we know. Interest rates are not relevant when we were talking about housing prices being unaffordable. If rates come down, prices will inevitably rise faster, leading to the exact same situation as beforehand. Oh, I think you were agreeing with me in a strange way. Do you think there's an actual plan to replace Biden? I mean, I'm sure they've discussed it. God, it's just so much. It would just be so crazy. Hey, you asked for me? Oh, my God, he's pissing. Hello? What's up? What are you doing? You. You hear me? Yeah, yeah. There's some construction going on. I don't know if you can hear it. Jesus. This could be your home.\\n\\nD: You could live here.\\n\\nDestiny: Are you. Are you in your house right now, and there's just that noise. I'm moving in between different places. You know, lawyers were always on the move, you know? Okay. When my boy calls me and he says, you have cl, you know, okay, so what's good? Oh, not that. I just wanted to, I just wanted to vent.\\n\\nD: Yeah, tell me.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, now that we are, we've been, fuck. Your background just killing me. Oh, no, it was just, it was over the, it was just over the 14th amendment stuff. We read through the, the brown v. Board decision yesterday. That's like a through. Wait, hello? You read through brown v board? Yeah. It's like 14 pages, right? Yeah, but I didn't see you do that. Yeah. Okay, wait here. Hold on. We'll chat later, okay. Holy shit, I'm gonna kill myself. You're, it is the most cancersus I've ever heard of my entire life. I'm gonna kill myself. O but love. Yeah, we can talk later, okay? Love you. Okay, could you explain, please explain the connection between housing prices and student loans? Yeah. I feel like this gets, like, talked about a lot, but nobody, but I don't know how many people understand this. I've never taken a formal econ class, so if I get this wrong, feel free to correct me. Okay? Look, this is how the whole world works. This is all, this is all of economics right here. Boom. The whole of economics is right here. This is it. Okay? This is all you have to know. I'm just kidding. I don't know who, I don't know how they normally label one ax. Actually, I don't think it matters so much, but this curve right here, or, I'm sorry, this axis, this axis, this line segment is the, hold on. It's like the quantity of goods produced, we'll say supply. Okay, this is your, wait, actually, we can do this really easily, okay, hold on. This is number of units. This is number of units. And then this is cost. Oh, man. I'm sure they labele these way different. I don't care. Okay, this line right here is demand, okay? When the price is very, very, very low, the, oh, wait, shit. Hold on. Let's. Hold on. Let's wipe this out. Okay? Boom, there we go. Okay. All right. We did it. Okay. When the price of a thing is very, very, very low. Okay. No, no, wait. Oh, fuck. That was right. I'm fucking my mind. Hold on. Don't worry. We'll figure this out. Come back in 30 seconds. Let's make this one price. This looks better. And then this is the number. Okay? Okay. When the price of a thing right here, this axis, is very low than the number of things. Wait, why am I fucking my mind up? This point up here would be a high price and a low number. Oh, yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. It's been too long since I've drawn a graph. Holy shit. Okay. When the cost of a particular good is very, very. Is very high, the quantity of a good demanded is very low, right? So let's imagine that we walk into a store and Coca Cola is being sold here at $5 million a can, right? So if we do this, then we would never want to buy, like, only one guy's evernna buy that coke can, right? The price right here is very high, and then the number, the quantity demanded is very low. Oay. Some people might label these differently and draw different, but it's the same concept oay down here. Let'say that. Let's say that you're a supplier oay. If the price of a particular thing is very low, you're not going to want to make very many of those things, or maybe none of it, right? In real life, by the way, these lines are not perfectly equal. But so, down here, when you supply a given thing, if the price is very, very low for that good or service, you're not going to want to supply very much of it. Right? And then if you go to the other end here, right? Let's say it. Let's say that the price of a thing is very, very, very high, right? Well, you want to make lots of those things, assuming, you know, there's profit, all that shit, bl blah. We're going, okay? And then along this axis here, right? If the cost of a thing is very, very, very low, then as a consumer, you'd want to buy a ton of it. Right? Okay, so talking through both of these real quick. Okay, so the quantity supplied by producer down here moves up along this axis as the price increases. Okay, you're telling me you're gonna coke sells for dollar one a can? I'm not making any of it. Fuck that. All right? But then you come up here and you're telling me I can sell a billion dollars for one coke can. I'm making so many of these cans. Okay, so you're gonna supply more and more and more of a thing, depending on the price. But a consumer, right, the demand for that demand is always spoken about or should be spoken about, I believe or no, I can't make any fuck retard. Demand, oftentimes, at least in theoretical models, have spoken about demand. At a given price, because demand will change, responsive to prices depending on elasticity. That doesn't matter right now. Okay, so let's say that that billion dollar coke can is up here, right? It costs a billion dollars. You're not gonna wan toa buy any of them. Then you go all the way down here, and the coke can is $0.01. You're gonnanna buy a ton of them. Okay. Somewhere there is a quantity demanded that consumers have at a given price that matches. There's gonna be some intersection here with the quantity produced by a given supplier. Right. At that point here, you call this market equilibrium. This is the point at which the market settles. If suppliers were to create more than this, if the number were to increase, then that would mean that the price would have to go down because consumers aren't going to buy more, right? Let's say that the supplier wants to make, if there are ways to draw, like, all sorts of cute little things. If the supplier is making a ton of things down over here, right? Like, the cost is high or the cost is the same, but they're making more of a given thing. Consumers aren't gonna buy that much because consumers don't have the money or the desire, whatever. They're not gonna buy over here. Right? I don think, I feel like I didn't explain this very well. I think that makes sense, right? Did this make sense? Sure. No. Yes. No. Okay. Good enough. Okay. Al right. There are different things that you can do in order to change where these particular lines go. Okay, so, okay, let's see if we can do this. For instance, let's say that we want to sell electric vehicles. O but let's say that a consumer, let's say that, okay, so hold on. Arese parts of this. I think realistically, I think your supply is probably going to look for your producers. They're not perfect lines, right? How do they draw these in textbooks? They must have modified lines, because I imagine in the real world, what a supply line is going to look like is you're not going to want to produce anything at a given price. And then once that price reaches a certain point, then you're going to want to start to produce. But maybe that's, like up here, right? And then the line goes like this, right? But let's say that, like, your consumer demand is never going to want to purchase anything like up here, right? So at a certain dollar amount, producers will produce a given thing, but that dollar amount is too high. So your consumption, you don't hit like a good market equilibrium, meaning maybe some consumers will buy it, but like most people don't. So what you want to do is you want to make it easier to produce a given thing so you can provide, like, a subsidy. And what the subsidy does is the subsidy brings down the cost. It would shift down this whole producer thing, right? So we could bring. So rather than having, like, I think, like, this type of thing, we can have like, this type of thing, right? Because we've shifted the whole line down because we're providing a subsidy, which is moving this line down because we made it cheaper to manufacture a given thing, I think, okay. Or on the flip side, instead of providing a subsidy to the manufacturer, we could shift the demand line up, right? And we could say that we're going to give a tax credit to somebody that purchases a particular thing. And that would cause this whole line to move up a bit, right? Well, before a consumer would buy an electric car if it was dollar 100, but not if it was $1,000.01. But if I tell a consumer, okay, well, hey, what if I give you a $900 tax credit? If you buy, well, okay, it's $1,000. I'm only willing to spend 100. But if I get a nine hundredlars tax credit. Yeah, I'll buy it now. Right. So you're moving the line up. Okay, I think I could have explained this a lot more succinctly. It makes sense. I promise all this to say that if we look at housing, if we look at housing prices and you look at the supply of housing, and you look at the demand for housing, if you were to actually, I don't even need to draw these lines. Fuck this. I should be. I should work with these a lot more because it help my understanding a bit more or be able to explain it better. Actually, no, you know what? You should be able to move the lines around on a supply and demand graph because it really helps you understand, I think, like, what is actually happening when certain things are happening in the market. So let's say that our. Can I select this line? No, fuck. Whatever. Let's say that this is the quantity supplied, right? So as the price increases, we're supplying more and this is the quantity demanded. Right? So the problem with forgiving student loan debt is that if we forgive student loan debt, what we're doing is we're increasing the money available to these people. So look at what happens. Okay? This line is gonna go straight up, all right? But when this line goes up, okay, it's going up, up, up, up, up. Look at what's happening to the equilibrium point, right as the line goes up. Because these people now have more money, right? You've got the more money. As more money is happening, the market equilibrium is hitting a different spot because consumers are willing to pay more because they have more money available to them. However, in the housing markets, the supply is relatively fixed, meaning consumers cannot produce the same amount of a good or service in response to a demand to hit this equilibrium point. So if they can't do that, then what happens? The demand for the existing stock, the existing supply increases. The supply remains fixed, so the cost increases. So the new market equilibrium is just a higher cost for the same number of goods and services. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? I feel like I kind of sort of explain that. So like, I imagine if you were to draw a supply, if you were to draw a supplyied thing for homes, it would probably look something like, how would we draw this? So the number is always going to be somewhat fixed. It's going to look something like. This is my guess. Something like this. Am I correct here? Functions only go one way, my friends. So the issue is that if consumers have this amount of money, your ability to make more houses, let's say that this is our equilibrium point, right? As you increase the money supply available at some point. I don't even know where the equilibrium is right now. I should have drawn this a little differently, right? As the money increases here and the ability to make more of a supply here like, is capped, right? Artificially. Because you can only build so much. The only thing that happens is, is prices steeply climb and that's it. And they climb very steeply. More steeply than if it was like. Than if they were able to keep up with the new demand. Fuck does that make sense? The technical term is short run supply curve versus long run supply curve. Okay, whatever. Anyways, all this to say if there were a thousand houses available and a bunch of people are complaining that they can't afford those thousand houses. If you give all of those people more money, the form of student loan, debt forgiveness, and they go look at those thousand houses again. Well, now the people selling the homes are looking at people with a lot more money. So the price of those homes is going to increase. And now the people that have more money are complaining because. Wait, what the fuck? Why are the prices going up? Well, it's because you guys all have more money now you're willing to pay more for them, right? The equilibrium point is increasing. There you go. Okay. Maybe you should review the episode of DuckTales. Is that a real episode of DuckTales? That's they are good arguments are cutting rates. For example, most current inflation is caused by housing prices. And in order to build, you rely on high debt through instruments like mortgages. Hence, high rates reduce housing supply, leading to increased inflation potentially. Yeah, like there is. Cutting rates can have pressure in both ways as well. So for instance, if mortgage rates decrease, then the demand. Because remember, the quantity demanded will increase as the cost decreases, right? Like let's say that I go to the store and I want to spend $5 on coke. Let's say a coke is dollar. Let's say the next day coke is twol 50. Well, fuck it. I'm gonna buy two cokes. The quantity demanded at a given price. The quantity demanded changes as the price changes. Assuming there's some elasticity in the good. We're not talking about inelastic goods perand anybod brings up in. Okay, so for homes, if the interest rate goes down, then that means that more people should theoretically and to buy them because the money is cheaper. However. But there's a countervailing force here as well as interest rates go down, more people want to buy homes. Wait, was it just the construction argument? But more people are also building homes as well. And as interest rates go up, people should the they want to buy fewer homes. Oh, but there's that too. If interest rates go, for instance. So let's say interest rates go up. That would bring prices. Because interest rates are going up, the cost of housing would go up, the demand would go down, but as demand falls, the price will also fall. There's countervailing force in this too. Sorry. Interest rates are also complicated. Or housing is complicated because there's a lot of weird market forces at play because you have somewhat inelastic demand. Everybody needs a place to live. They don't necessarily need a mortgage, though. So effects to where you could rent a house, or you could rent an apartment instead of buying a house. So you've got a type of inelastic demand for a class of goods for housing, but there's elasticity within that class because you could get an apartment, you can get a house, or you could rent a house, and then you've got interest rates. So people are borrowing money, so that functions or that factors in as well. And then you've got a fixed supply of housing to some extent because you can't build infinite houses because the land is limited. Fuck houses. Okay, I don't remember. The point of all this was, oh, yeah, more money to students means housing prices. All else SQL will probably increase. That was the point. There you go. We answer that question. It only took us 30 minutes. EPA is not authorized by Congress.\\n\\nC: I'm asking you.\\n\\nDestiny: I thought EPA was authorized by Congress.\\n\\nC: Well, the EPA is not. The APA has never been formally authorized by Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: What is the. Wait, Boebert? EPA questions Congress authorized. Where is this full video? What does this come from? Is there like a C span link to this? This just happened today. Was this on like C Span or something? Over on four chan, they call you Fediny. Were you, they say a bunch of retarded showit on four chan. The most likely person to be a fed are some of those alt writers that were the gen six stuff and somehow never got arrested despite the fact that they were on camera being seen screaming like storm the building. Nick Fuente. Thank you for giving me an econ hard on. Love this shit. Wish I had found out I was ADHD back in high school so I could have pursued my PhD in econ like I wanted to. What did you get? A PhD. And instead, my friend, why build more housing when you can just subsidize demand? What is this? This is the most California story ever to help the housing crisis. They budgeted 300 million to pay for first time home buyers down payments in less than two weeks. They run out of money and only help 2300 people. $300 million? 2300 people help. Jesus.\\n\\nD: How?\\n\\nDestiny: I'm sorry, my mind fucking myself on the math here. Is this $100,000 per person or am I missing a zero? There? $100,000 times 2000. Jez. Wait, are they subsidizing like the entire down payment? What the fuck? Have you ever been approached by a woman in public for the purpose of dating? Not in any circumstance that would be relatable to an ordinary person. But also, I never go out 20 minutes. Fine to the VOD. But you arent correct about the feds approach to inflation. The fed doesnt. Or the price level. They target the inflation rate at 2%. There are good reasons for this. Okay, that might be true. This must be why you're a progressive who wants higher taxes but wants to live in a low tax state. A I don't think I've ever my life said I want higher taxes ever. I don't think I've ever said that. I don't know if I've ever made that prescription or claim. That's a thing that I desire in anything ive ever seen the last five years stare. You dont want higher spending. If there are programs that I like, then yeah, you can have higher spending and you need sometimes more taxes to pay for it. But that's not the same as saying that you want higher taxes, right? I feel like you're doing the connector thing in your mind without realizing it. Like if somebody is like, like if somebody is s like, oh, like there's a pr that I'm really trying to, or a PB I'm really trying to push past. Like I really want to be able to bench or squat or whatever. Like would you look at a person go like, oh, you want to spend more time in the gym? U you want to go to the gym that much more? Like, well, no, not really. But thats the thing that you have to do to effect the other thing at the end. Heres the timestamp for the hearing. What a shit argument. You do want higher taxes, not for the sake of higher taxes, but in effect you do. I guess. I don't know if you can transfer I don't know if you can transfer desires like that. So for instance, let's say that a person has cancer and they need to do chemotherapy. Would you say that that person wants to be sick and nauseous all the time? Five minutes.\\n\\nC: Thank you, mister chairman. Administrator Regan, is it true that the EPA has never obtained formal authorization legislation from congress?\\n\\nDestiny: I'm sorry?\\n\\nC: Is it true that the EPA has never obtained formal legation authoritation legislation from Congress?\\n\\nDestiny: I feel like the spending is already impied. Obviously, no one just wants taxes for their own sake. I disagree. I think when progressives and shit talk about taxation, from the way that I hear it, and I could be wrong, but it sounds like to them, taxes are a punishment to be levied upon billionaires in the wealthy to punish them for their wealth. That's what it sounds like to me when I hear about progressives talk about, I usually hear another like, you need to pay your fair share or the american public, you need to give back to the american public. It always, it comes from this, like very like scolding, like accusatory perspective. That's what it feels like, me. And then when conservatives talk about taxes, yeah, they talk about taxes as like a punishment. Why does the government steal my money? Like, why do I have to work for the government two days a week in blah blah blah blah blah? People seem to talk about taxes as though they're an end to themselves. Maybe because of the disconnect we have between the taxes and the, between the government income and the government outlays, because we borrow so much. But come on, bro, they're usually saying that so they can fund universal Medicare and shit like that. I very, very rarely, if ever, I've heard a progressive connect taxation to hypothetical programs. I just don't hear that speak very much. And they seem to demonize wealthy people a lot. I can't believe we disagree on this, but I, he maybe actually, when Bernie Sanders ran, actually, I think Bernie Sanders did a good job at connecting the two. I remember Bernie Sanders actually had a graph for, what am I thinking? In one of his campaign things, he had a graph for like a proposed program and then a tax that he wanted to tie it to. Fuck, I'm not goingna be able to find it. Bernie Sanders, I think, probably did a good job for the messaging on this. But the vast majority of the time I hear progressives or Democrats talk about taxes, it usually just comes off as like a demonization of wealthy people.\\n\\nC: Congress, it's never been authorized by Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: EPA is not authorized by Congress.\\n\\nC: I'm asking you.\\n\\nDestiny: I thought EPA was authorized by Congress.\\n\\nC: Well, the EPA is not. The EPA has never been formally authorized by Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so we know this is not true, right?\\n\\nC: However, this agency has imposed over $1.3 trillion in regulatory costs since the Biden regime took office. We authorized committees here in Congress.\\n\\nDestiny: I think states should try it. Actually, I encourage that. That was a strong argument that was given a long time ago. Was that an x skills me argument? That if people think that like a national type healthcare should work, then states should try it? In California, I think they have, it's called Medi Cal. So I think that, I think didn't Romney, wasn't Romney care a thing that people spoke about? So I think some states have tried it. But wait, let me grab a bow. Rep, you ready? Reviewed the Chevron case? Yeah, we read the whole fucking thing.\\n\\nC: To ensure that we have proper oversight and accountability in the functioning of the executive branch. And this process is extremely vital because often we see agencies for oversight and accountability in manatory costs since the Biden regime took office, we authorize committees here in Congress to ensure that we have proper oversight and accountability in the functioning of the executive branch. And this process is extremely vital because often we see agencies abuse the separation of powers, creating rules without consent of Congress, and we appropriate funds to agencies.\\n\\nDestiny: We often see people break agencies.\\n\\nC: And this process is extremely vital because often we see agencies abuse the separation of powers, creating rules and laws, regulations.\\n\\nDestiny: What laws has an agency created? Theoretically that should be impossible, right? I can't tell if there's like, there are likeific, like specific or particular things that I'm unaware of, or she has no idea how the government works. I'm not. I don't know. Given that we just saw the EPA is authorized by congressional statute, as I'm almost positive every single executive office must be constitutionally. I can't wait for us to go over constitution.\\n\\nC: Mister chairman. Administrator Regan.\\n\\nDestiny: I push control t. Is this article. What part is the. Nope. Article three. Is that the judiciary or is that the judiciary? Article. Article four. No. Yes. Congress? No. Article two. So it would be under the executive control f office. Hold on, I'm trying to see. We just read the part where it says she's calling regulations to past what Congress authorized laws made by the agencies. I'm sorry, but I am. I'm re peeling back. Remember? We're peeling back this year. I'm not going to be that charitable to people anymore. So, no, I'm going to say if that's what you meant, you should have spoke clear. I don't get anywhere near that level of charitability if I misspeak or if I'm slightly wrong on something. So I'm not granting that much charitability to somebody that says that the executive agencies are creating laws. You have to explicitly explain that you are being hyperbolic or metaphorical when you say that. Wait, what part of the. Okay, hold on. Constitution. Creation of executive offices. It wasn'article two. What'the? Language article. He shall have power b, and with the advising consent of the Senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present to concur, and he shall nominate in b with the advising toent of the Senate. He shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and councils, judges of the Supreme Court and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not here and otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law. I think it would be this part. Right. But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law or in the heads department. Okay, so, article two, section two, clause two. The president of the United States shall have the power bind with the advisingent of the senate to appoint officers whose appointments are not here and otherwise provided for, so not explicitly listed in the Constitution. And those shall be established by law, meaning from the legislature. Okay, this is where the creation of offices spoken in the Constitution for how the Congress makes offices that exist under the president of the United States to help him in the enforcement of laws passed by Congress. Okay.\\n\\nC: Again, is it true legislation from Congress? It's never been authorized.\\n\\nDestiny: I thought EPA was authorized by Congress.\\n\\nC: Well, the EPA is not. The EPA has never been formally authorizedoseded over $1.3 trillion inprise committees here in Congress to ensure that we have proper oversight and accountability in the functioning of the executive branch. And this process is extremely vital because often we see agencies ab used the separation of powers, creating rules and laws, regulations without consent of Congress, and we appropriate funds to agencies like the EPA and expect these tax dollars and this tax dollar funding to be used in accordance with the legislative priorities and comply with the oversight requirements. So, Mister Regan, last month the Supreme Court rightly overturned the Chevron doctrine, which the EPA relied on to support its very controversial and costly rulemakings. Since your agency has never been authorized by Congress and has since, that's not true. But lost most legal standing, that's also absolutely not true.\\n\\nDestiny: And it's even explicitly spelled out in the Chevron decision. If something was ruled with Chefron deference in the past, we're not overturning all of those cases. They can be challenged again if you wish. There's no guarantee you'll win. You can challenge, you wish. But he explicitly put that that's not true, that they lost their legal standing.\\n\\nC: Authorized by Congress, and has since lost most legal standing. Does your agency still plan to enable rogue bureaucrats to enact unconstitutional regulations?\\n\\nDestiny: I'm not quite sure I follow you. You're saying that.\\n\\nC: I'm saying the Chevron doctrine was overturned by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nDestiny: We have no, we have all authority.\\n\\nC: I'm saying you've never been authorized.\\n\\nDestiny: Wait, hold ongress doesn't delegate authority for us to do the regulations in the business and the policy. So since he's just explaining how government works, like incredulously, Congress doesn't authorize the right like they do. Right. 1970.\\n\\nC: So the Chevron doctrine, where you have created all of these rules under that have been proven to be unconstitutional.\\n\\nDestiny: None of what she just said there.\\n\\nC: Was true by the Supreme Court has been overruled. So now I'm asking, are your bureaucrats still going to implement these rulemaking processes?\\n\\nDestiny: Nothing. Her question isn't even wrong. It just doesn't even make sense. Nothing she's saying is even remotely like tethered to reality here. My guess would be I don't know how stupid or how far up the stupidity runs. I don't know if Boebert understands how government works. I'm curious what her. I'm gonna look it up and she's gonna be like fucking Yale law graduate, cum laude, top of her fucking class there. Some crazy shit, huh? Lauren Boebert, politician, businesswoman and guns rights activist. Restaurant ownership. Jesus, what is this? She owned a bar Bobert and her husband opened, shooters Grill in Rifle, west of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Boebert says that she obtained a concilt car permit after a man was beaten to death by another man's hands outside of her restaurant and began encouraging the restaurants s servers to carry guns openly. That is mostly false. In 2013, a man who had fell and died from a methamphetamine overdose died from a methhamphamine overdose. How much meth do you need to do for an overdose to kill you? I want the autopsy o fuck the raw investigative files. Or actually, wait, we can look up ld 50 methamphetamine. Wait, is it ld 50? Thats the word I im looking for, right? There's no shout. The official cause of death is methl. Yeah, my actually like die from a meth overdose is really hard. I don't know, like, I think you have to take like an ungodly amount. I don't know why the ld 50 isn't listed in an easy to find placeicer examine after this. Ld 50 methem amphetamine humans methamphetamine abuse is an important problem in Thailand. The number of addicts and abuses is increasing. Abusers usually use speed pills by oral ingestin or inhalation. The dose uses about five to 60 milligrams of methamphetamine. While the lethal dose reported as 200 milligrams. Death due to methamphetamine toxicity is uncommon. Is it 200? Really? I would have assumed it would have been higher, maybe 200. 200 milligrams is nothing of meth. 200 isnna blow your that'that's? A pretty sure 200 milligrams of meth is gonna be a huge, that would be a huge hit. I think if you get, if you prescribed methamphetamine as a medication, I think that is the upper bound like 15 or 20 prescription amounts. What is the max? The usual effect of dose is 20 to 25 milligrams daily. Max dosage. Shouldn't it be like, like an FDA sheet on this or something? Max. Oh, wait, is this it? It doesn't list the huh. We dont have good experimental human LD 50 values for most drugs. We usually model and extrapolate from rodent data. I guess that makes sense'like, you can test a bunch of humans in controlled environments to see but how long does it take for meth to take effect for meth? I'm pretty sure it's very, very, very fast. Like if you eat. If you eat methamphetamine, like even for a pill, isn't it like within five minutes if you smoke it, it's probably almost instant. Wait, you smoke meth, right? Yes. Why do I keep searching? I keep getting stupid government websites. I don't know if I doing. I'm not sure. How did you get started on 60 vivance is's a dextrohamphhetamine. It'not methamphetamine. Even eating it hits fast. Yeah. The point of for methamphetamine, I don't know why we could look it up. Fuck it, why not? Yeah, that's what we're doing. We're reading something about the methyl group allows it to pass the blood brain barrier very quickly or instantly. I don't think it, like, it just goes through like very, very quickly. I don't know why, but it'something to do with the methyl group attached, I think listex or Dex. The amphetamine and vibance is dextro amphetamine. There's a lysine attachment, but dextrohetamine doesn't as readily cross the blood brain barrier as methamphetamine does. But methamphetamine does very quickly. I just don't know. I don't know why, dude. Okay, is there a way to exclude a domain when you search for drugs? You should be able to auto exclude every dot gov dot. Any information about a illegal drug from any government website is always fucking dogshit. Lauren probably didn't even write those questions. It was probably a staffer. How do you feel about proxy voting in the senate? I don't know what that even means. What kind of staffer vote for you? Oh, maybe somebody did write it for actually. Okay. It's a classical stimulus substance of the amphetamine class. It is structurally related to amphetamine. However, it crosses the blood brain barrier more rapidly due to its relatively high lipid solubility. This is in 2006. Did we even have science back then? Unlike cocaine, which works principally by blocking plasma membrane transporters that reuptake monoamines, methamphetamine exerts multiple pharmacological effects via different molecular processes. The primary mechanisms by which the amphetamine class of drugs increase levels. The redistribution of. Wait, I just. I always assume that cocaine was an amphetamine, but I guess it's not. It's a stimulant. Huh. Does that mean that cocaine is more similar to like methylphenidate than it would be for like a methamphetamine that's what it sounded like. It just blocks. It blocks reuptake instead of causing more shit to leak out basically. Im pretty sure if its xrvvance its listxemhetamine vivance is a name stands for the compound two molecules together a compound of lysine and dextro amphetamine but the thing that activates in your brain or whatever the lysine thing is stripped off by the liver and then youve got dextro amphetamine is the thing that is doing stuff in your body I just don I dont know why its harder for dextro amphetamine or an amphetamine to get to your brain instead of a methamphetamine I think methamphetamine just means there'a methyl is that literally it? Yeah okay yeah we will look well read because I have nothing else to do today. Destiny no lol no what? Lol amphetamines and stimulants are different I always said amphetamines were a type of stimulant yes stimulants are anything that increase Cn's activity I think and amphetamine is a class of stimulant STn class drugs that increase the activity of the brain. They use for various why'you go with extended release rather than immediate release because you do immediate release it like spikes more and you have got to take multiple pills a day and fuck all that shit. And one meth funidate Daca asked if cokeh agreed with me before he prescribed it rather than add bayed okay fuck this too much for now. Fuck the brain chemistry showed is too much. The diagram depicts the neuroimmune mechanisms that mediate methamphetamine induced neurodegeneration in the human brain. The NFKB mediated neuroimmune response to methamphetamine use, which results in the increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, arises through its binding at an activation of sigma receptors. Beha I don't think this is somebody will post on the separated about this wait. Following oral administration ofhetamine as well absorbed the bloodstream with peak plasma methamphetamine concentrations achieved in approximately three to 6 hours post ingestion. Methamphetamine is also well absorbed following inhalation and following intran nasal administration. Because of the high lipoplicityhilicity of methamphetamine due to its methyl group, it can readily move through the blood ve grain barrier faster than other stimulants, where it is more resistant to degradation by monoamine oxidase. When taken orally, 30% to 54% of the dose is excreted in urine as methamphetamine, and ten to 23% is amphetamine. Damn. Because you drink like a fucking meth head's urine and get methed out. Okay. Anyway, I don't think this guy died from meth overdose, but he might have. Who knows? I guess he could have. All right, back to good friend. You do know chevron is not just focused on EPA, but you are.\\n\\nC: So I'm asking about the EPA, and I'm asking about your rogue bureaucrats that have enacted these unconstitutional regulations. Are you going to repeal them?\\n\\nDestiny: The funniest meme. If you wanted to fight with conservatives on this, and I might, because I think. I think Michael Knowles brought this up in his chevron thing. Did he not have a YouTube video on it? Br, you're really gonna. It was this, but I think it was, like, a YouTube video. Nice. Whatever is conservatives will say now that we've gotten rid of chevron, we don't have to worry about unelectable bureaucrats or unelected bureaucrats writing laws for the United States. However, the point of the Roberts decision is you actually do want elected bureaucrats that are writing rules and regulations. You do want unelected people deciding law. So when they say things like, oh, bureaucrats who are unelected are making these big decisions, well, that's what the Supreme Court wanted. They want unelected people making these decisions, which is why it was supposed to go to the court, where they have political installation with lifetime tenures. So it's funny that I think Knowles said that was the main reason, or that was a big reason. Why Robert spoke about getting rid of Chevron is because it shouldn't be electable. People that are making these, like, legal decisions, because their legal, like, opinions could change on a political whim. This a random.\\n\\nC: Are you going to continue to implement them, or are you going to stop altogether since it's been overturned?\\n\\nDestiny: Do you understand the ruling?\\n\\nC: Do you?\\n\\nDestiny: No. Oh, he realizeds she has no idea what she's talking about. Is there a good short form explanation to the new Chevron decision, or should I watch your vod of you reading it? I thought about making a video on it, but it'kind of boring, and I don't think I even disagree that much. I'm not sure. Maybe I can. Maybe I could make a video on it. Don't.\\n\\nC: And to stop alltogether since it's been overturned.\\n\\nDestiny: Do you understand the ruling?\\n\\nC: Do you understand the ruling of the supreme Court?\\n\\nDestiny: I do. And so your question is, is ill formed. No.\\n\\nC: Will you?\\n\\nDestiny: You'not gonna stop, so you're going to. Yeah, this is what I said earlier. It was like her question is not even wrong. It just doesn't even make sense. I feel like she doesn't understand how.\\n\\nC: The government works unconstitutionally. Continue with the.\\n\\nDestiny: We're going to rulaking. We're going to adhere to the supreme Court and continue to.\\n\\nC: So which rule are you going to roll back?\\n\\nDestiny: We're going to adhere to the supreme Court and continue to do our work in accordance to the supreme Court. The supreme Court.\\n\\nC: So which ones are you going to repeal?\\n\\nDestiny: The Supreme Court didn't tell us to repeal anything. The Supreme Court. Yeah. And he should be even stronger with that. The Supreme Court. That statutory stare decisis, meaning a respect for a prior ruling would apply to every previous rule that had already been ruled under Chevron deference. So he can be even stronger with a statement there. I don't know why we're fact checking Boeber. It is a waste of fucking time. Just as a real quick by doing so, however, we do not call in into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework. The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful, including the Clean Air act holding of Chevron itself, are still subject to statutory stare decisis, despite our change in interpretive methodology. So they're not overruling or saying anything else is, like, illegal or against whatever. That's not happening. But, I mean, obviously she hasn't read the case, but I don't even know if she has a summary of the case.\\n\\nC: The Supreme Court, which ones are you going to repeal?\\n\\nDestiny: The Supreme Court didn't tell us to repeal anything.\\n\\nC: They have been deemed unconstitutional.\\n\\nDestiny: No, they haven't. Nothing here was even a matter of constitutionality, really. Truly. It was just a matter of the type of legal review being applied. No, absolutely. They have.\\n\\nC: This was a huge victory. And, you know, I mean, even in our appropriations bill, you actually like lost.\\n\\nDestiny: Stuff, or are you just doing this to get informed? I think lost stuff is really interesting. I feel like it's got, there's like a definitive structure, and then you can make arguments within the structure or you can argue for the structure itself. But I feel like if you like programming or like factorio or any autistic shit like that, I feel like the lost stuff is interesting. I think it's interesting and intriguing. And the law stuff is cooler because it, it has so much like foundation founding the country. Right. The way that our law and our government is structured is important. It's meaningful. It impacts you on a daily basis. It sets the United States apart from most other countries in the world. Like, it's cool.\\n\\nC: They have, this was a huge victory. And, you know, I mean, even in our appropriations bill in the house this.\\n\\nDestiny: Year, I don't know why people typ this. You can argue the separation of power'argument to remove deference is a constitutional matter. You might be able to argue that Boebert can't, and she's sure as fuck is not. So I don't know why. Well, actually, actually, every single thing, actually, can thetically be interpreted. Yeah, that's great. Thank you for that. Thanks for the contribution.\\n\\nC: The funding has been reduced by 20%. I would argue that it means. Absolutely, they have. This was a huge victory. And, you know, I mean, even in our appropriations bill in the house this year, the funding has been reduced by 20%. I would argue that it needs to be reduced by 100%.\\n\\nDestiny: Earlier, when people were talking about taxes, when she's talking about funding, she's not talking about like, well, here's the programs we need. Here's the programs that we don't need. So let's, like, adjust our funding. She's like, get rid of all the funding. It's bad. It's evil government spending, bad. Like, it's just a statement on the morality of taxation or the morality of government spending without, like, an actual consideration of the programs that anyone's even funding.\\n\\nC: But in this, it's because of these radical Green New Deal policies that jeopardize domestic energy development and overload America's power grid and raise costs on american consumers and businesses. So with the EPA in these overreaching.\\n\\nDestiny: Regulations, do you, Representative Bober posted this video on her channel as a win.\\n\\nC: Have any intent on working with the House majority to lower energy costs and produce more reliable and affordable energy?\\n\\nDestiny: If you look at our rule, we are producing reliable, affordable, diverse.\\n\\nC: I think America's wallet, American'wallets would disagree with that. I mean, the Biden administration, if they continue under Obama's administrative policies, this regulatory pace for a full eight years, the cumulative cost of this administration's rulemaking would exceed $60,000 per household. And as you knowide, the Biden administration reversed President Trump's successful deregulation by executive orders. So the Biden regime is on pace of increasing regulatory costs at a rate of $617 billion per year. And just rulemaking. Rulemaking that we are seeing is unconstitutional.\\n\\nDestiny: It's just shocking. You spend so much time with our regional staff and have such productive conversations about how we're doing things for your district and your state. And then you take this microphone and.\\n\\nC: You I've also seen the coal plants that have been decommissioned in my state. One I've seen the energy regulations that have regulated my district into poverty.\\n\\nDestiny: You'spending time with my so sure in your district?\\n\\nC: Of course I am. I have oversight over your staff and.\\n\\nDestiny: I want complimeer she is that true? She does every single office have an oversight accountability thing? EPA oversight, Wikipedia. What would you call like the or is it the OAG? The office of Committee Oversight EPA House Oversight subcommittee on the environment was a subcommittee within the was dissolved in this of republic to control. Oh damn. I wonder what? Why. Guess we just look her up and see what committee she's on huh? Lauren Bobert. I love God. I'm so sorry. No, I'm not actually. I'm glad. I'll bleed. I will gladly bleed my conservative fans. On January 5, the day before the storming of the United States Capitol, Boebert urged people to remember these next 48 and the hours before the Capitol was attacked. She described the day's events as republican 1776 moment. What was that again? Was that just a protest? 1776. Oh. Committees and caucuses. Thank you. Co chair of the Congressional second amendment Caucus. Communications chair of the House Freedom Caucus, remember of the Congressional Western Caucus. Rem member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. There's no way thats as fucking stupid. Thats not a real thing, is it? The congressional blockchain caucus? It must mean something in politics or actually, you know what? Sorry. I hear blockchain and I get triggered. Technically. Actually I guess it wouldn't necessarily be bad at people in Congress who have an interest in stuff where related to cryptocurrency. That's not actually a bad thing. Sorry, I'm just predisposed to hate this person. It's not necessarily a bad thing.\\n\\nC: I want them to provide a although.\\n\\nDestiny: I would pay a lot of money to hear her explain for 15 minutes what a blockchain is. I would love to hear that. Do these videos exist? Bobert explains blockchain. Or how about Bobert explains crypto? Bobert explains cryptocurrency. God I would love this. O okay, never mind.\\n\\nC: You're not aware of any employee taking something that one would consider a vacation time and bringing their computer and maybe logging in just a portion of that time or not at all.\\n\\nDestiny: We.\\n\\nC: We have more than 25% of federal employees not, not logging into work, and they're teleworking.\\n\\nDestiny: Congresswoman, I do take issue with the characterization.\\n\\nC: Leaked document right here that we just submitted into the record.\\n\\nB: You're basing that from 2020, which is.\\n\\nDestiny: In the last administration, and I can't speak to that.\\n\\nC: Course I am. I have oversight over your staff, and I want complime to provide a service for the american complimenting them. But there are so much. Yes, there are some things that have been done well, but not every 100%.\\n\\nDestiny: When we have 617 76 represents a conservatives more than just the revolution. You had this issue with protesterester on January 6. I attended tea party rallies over ten years ago that had 1776 merchandise and paraphernalia everywhere. It represents to them freedom and independence, not just revolution. One thing that I've come to appreciate. Oh, fuck. What was I reading? I don't think it was the federalist papers. I don't remember what I was reading about. But basically when you. Things like freedom and democracy don't really mean anything in and of themselves. These are like, incredibly abstract and sophisticated concepts that in order to ensure them have so many different approaches and built in, like, safeguards, I guess, to make sure that it works as an example, like, if you want to live in, then having a pure democracy where every single decision of the government is left to referendum would probably be one of the worst ways to do that, right? So you might think that, like, oh, well, we value, like, democracy. It's like, well, what do you mean by that? Because on the flip side of this, some conservatives will say things like, oh, well, we don't have a real democracy. We don't elect every single person. Like, well, yeah, if you elect every single person, that doesn't necessarily make it better. The public having to say over every single thing doesn't necessarily make it better. There's just more voting. But it wouldn't necessarily accomplish what the goal of a democracy is. That in the aggregate represents the voice of the people, right. Because if you had a government where 51% of the vote could make dramatic changes to any policy at any point in time, it would be a shit show, right? So, yeah, I just. I don't have very much. Maybe this sounds elitist, but I don't very much respect or care for somebody who's like, I like freedom and freedom and freedom. I'like, okay, what do you mean by that? Freedom to do what? Like, can I go, like, kill your children? Well, not that much freedom. Why not? So you're restricting my freedom? Well, that's different though, because if you exercise your freedom to take away the freedom from somebody else, that's actually not freedom. Oh, okay, what about like a gang rape oay? Because that's ten people getting maximum freedom in exchange for one person not having any freedom. But I mean, that seems to be like, in a utilitarian sense, a good trade off, right? Well, that's different. Some crimes you just shouldn't do. Okay, no freedom where you're. We're taking somebody else's freedom away. Okay, so we can't have any freedoms at all where we're infringing on the. Some kind of freedom from other people. So. So that's one hard rule that's already restricting a ton of behavior. And then how far does that extend? Right, okay, well, let's say that I want to build something on my property that crosses over into your property. Do you have access? Like, do you have restrictive property rights that restrict my freedom just to build. Or how about to even walk in places in the United States of America if you're european, at least in Sweden, I think you can walk across like, vast swathes of, like, privately owned land. If, like, I don't think it matters as much. I don't even know think. I think in Sweden explicitly, it's not illegal in the United States. You can't do that. It's considered trespassing. If you walk through, like, a farmer's fields, even if nobody's there, even whatever, the farmer can come out, find you, tell you, hey, get the fuck out or I'm gonna shoot you, or whatever can do it within their rights to do it. Right? So is that freedom? Is it more freedom that one man can have owning? Well, it's kind of freedom because he owns it. Okay, so you can own something. All this to say, and we could walk down like a billion different arguments. All this to say that when people are just like, oh, yeah, like freedom and democracy, and it'like, okay, that doesn't mean anything. These are words on paper. The structure and what you actually mean, you say that is so much more important than just the words themselves. Or there's that famous Jefferson quote that I don't even know is actually his fucking quote. Is this even a Jefferson quote or o. Franklin quote? It might just get attributed to everybody. Oh, yeah. You literally see both of it right here. But the quote or the. It's like a comic. I've seen it too. Democracy is two wolves in a lamb voting for what? To have for lunch. Liberty is a well armed lamb. Contesting the vote? That's not even really speaking to democracy or voting at all. Thats s just speaking to the right to own a firearm. Yeah.\\n\\nC: $117 billion per year in rulemaking.\\n\\nDestiny: I thought the USA had that as well. It's called easements. I believe an easement is just shared property between two people. 100%.\\n\\nC: When we have $617 billion per year in rulemaking. That is absolutely absurd. When you are taking our affordable clean energy and regulating it out existence and killing these good paying jobs in my district. Yes, I have a problem with that.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure.\\n\\nC: My time is expired and I yield.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, mister chairman, I think that was 46 seconds over. So we'll take that. Thank you. We'll take that. Oof. What do they put inister? If they took those worood. If we're gonna start timing people over, then you're gonna have to start editing your comments on your opening statements and everything else. But I will do that. Oh. Can you rationalize the military draft with respect to freedom? Yeah, sure. If the government has any essential function, it should be providing for the safety of its citizens against foreign powers. Right? If we even in the most, even the most libertarian libertarian would say that if he was going to strip away all the functions of government, a standing military, I would imagine, would be one of the last things to go off. If government is any essential function, it's to provide for the protection of its people. And sometimes to provide for the protection of your people, it might mandate or necessitate compulsory military service. Right. You might say that, like, listen, in order to, you know, afford for the defense of our country from a foreign power, people have to step up and fight. Yeah. $10 for being a gangster. Also, YouTube chat is wake willow and kick. Nice. An easement is a specific purpose for a section of property. No, I don't know. I thought, I thought an easement was just when two people can have a claim to the same property or they have like a shared. They have shared property. That's what I thought. The home that I owned in South Omaha, I had an easement with my neighbors because there that was on, I think, both of our properties. Or maybe it's a right to allow somebody toosse to use your property, something like that. I think it might actually, in easement might just be the right to utilize somebody else's property. So it belonged to one of us, but the other person could use it? I think maybe. Did you know that in ancient roman times, the average age of first time mothers was 13 years old. If I had to guess, I'm gonna guess it was 19 to 20. But let's check. Ancient Roman. Ancient Roman. Average age first time mother. Oh, 15. Damn. I thought that children today go through puberty earlier than they did in the past. Meaning if it would have been later in the past, they wouldn't even been able to have kids yet escaped death during child fairly long. Girls started perission after marriage 15 an average of seven. Can you really have a childhood or can you have a child at 15 on average in a healthy manner? I feel like your body is still too, too small. Optimal survival outcomes pregnancy. I thought that the optimal was like 19 to 22 or something. 84% of pregnancy related deaths are thought to be preventable. Wouldn't it be 100%? Just don't get pregnant. The ancient roman peasant were unaware of optimal in this case. I doubt that. I. People back in the day were probably very aware of the optimal times to have children. I bet that was probably one of the most important things. Well, maybe not in Roman, not when you've got all the agriculture, designing everything else, but the further back you go. No, hold on. No. Yeah, even then, because being able to produce a lot of children and having sons and workers and stuff was really important. Oh wait. Yeah. Wait, is this. Well this is linking from that. Although case of precocious puberty may be few far between the age of puberty, especially female puberty, has been decreasing in western cultures for decades now. For example, at the turn of the 20th century, the average or 17. Yeah, the average age of roman childbirth was 15 for sure, but not through the lens of our own understanding. They did the best they could with what they had and were wrong because of it. I'm not even talking right or wrong right now. I'm just saying that if you have a society where women die more often, if they have kids at 15, and they survive more often at 18 or 19, then my guess is going to be the families would prot protect the children from procreation or marriage until they were a little older. Because you dont want your children all dying in childbirth unless its a numbers game and you just start having them make a bunch of kids at 15 and then some of them die, some of them live and it doesnt t matter. But women are less useful for farming and stuff. N I think back way when I think most people could do most jobs, like, I think there was a lot of overlap. I don't think women were just like crocheting indoors all day. I think they did a lot of manual labor too. Optimal age of a mother is late twenties to early thirties. There's no shot. That's correct. Why is this harder to find? Optimal survival outcome, optimal age. Pregnancy was like, I thought it was a woman's peak. Reproductive years are between the late teens and late twenties. Okay, so maybe it'go later. Yeah, but I feel like I read like 19 to 22 at some point. Although this is just like a headline thing here. Experts say the best time to get pregnant between you, your late twenties and early thirties. Well, experts say the best time to get pregnant between late twenties. This is a different, this is answering like, this might be factoring in non biological things, right? That when a person is older, they're a little bit more mature, they can write. This is a different statement here. I'm merely speaking on like the physical, like survival rate and everything. All right? Okay. Don't know, don't care. How does the government have a right to tax our property? I mean, we have a right to property, right? How does a government have a right to tax, I mean, without a government, you wouldnt have any property, right? People would invade and kill you. If there was no government, then the defense of your property from foreign invaders would be completely on you. If Mexico wanted to invade Texas and you had property there, the mexican government would just come in and take it. If you want to defend it, you probably need to form an alliance with people. If you want to form an alliance with people, you're going to have to pay for some like collective protection services or organization or army. At some point you're just going to reconstruct taxation in order to defend your shit, bro. What it's called private military. Yeah. How do you think you fund it, chief? Where do you think the money comes from for that? Ancapss would disagree. Yeah, find me some. Find me the successful functioning and cap countries and then we can chat. Okay. Ancient Romans, life expectancy range between 20 and 30 years. Makes sense to get pregnant about 50. Now, life expectancy doesn't mean that they like between 20 and 30 years, like on average. That just means that from, I think from conception or like from birth, that's like the life expecty. If you die in childbirth, for instance, like, it dramatically brings down the life expectancy. But my guess is once you hit like your teens, the life expectancy was probably, my guess would be forties, fifties, sixties maybe, I don't know. Whole lot behind the scenes. The fuck is this? Okay, theres like three pixels here. Okay, let me this real quick and then were going to read for hamstc. Ok iranian hostage negotiations new fear unlocked. Where did this topic come from? As we read stuff and like situations or things come up and I'm like there's a lot of things like fuck I wish I knew more about this. Im just writing those down as they happen and then yeah ill just make notes on them and read them and know about them instead of saying I wish I knew about them. Sinatra o this usually happens to people with like TMJ or something right? So Blinken said that ukraine is heading towards NATO membership. I can't send link on YouTube. This is a good and beneficial foreign affairs policy. I seriously doubt that ukraine is heading for NATO membership. I doubt whatever you're saying we can look it up. Blinkoln NATO ukraine membership 5 hours ago Ukraine is on an irreversible path to NATO membership, US European said Wednesday, advancing assurances from allies that will be allowed to join the western military coalition after its war with Russia ends. This isn't happening. It's just not going to happen. I don't know what the context of the speech is. I don't know what. But this is. It's just not going to happen. It's too much. I don't even think every NATO member would approve at this point. Maybe they want to use this to leverage some kind of peace agreement from Russia. Maybe that'be my guess. But describe a lasting settlement between Ukraine and Russia that doesn't involve NATO membership for Ukraine. I mean the lasting settlement will just be whatever peace agreement that they carve out with each other. But I dont t think that it its just too tumultuous right now. Maybe in a decade maybe. But what do you think Ukraine should do moving forward? Reinstate nuclear program? If you were an unaligned country, an non aligned country, and you lived on Russia's borders. Yeah, I would do a nuclear program. Hell yeah. The fuck why wouldn't you? You should. That's the message that the U okay, so joining NATO basically quicker and easier way to get under a nuclear umbrella. Yeah. But I just don't think with all the tensions on the border, I don't think anybody would support it. There would be too great a risk of a NATO russian feud, which I don't think either side really wants. Wow. What's up, Lois? Okay. Hmm. Is there an alternative? More nukes being the only answer seems problematic. There are three options. I think there are three reasonable options ahead. The first option, which is if I was Ukraine, it'what I would do would be to immediately start a nuclear program and work on procuring nuclear weapons. The second option is to cede all the sovereignty of your country to Russia and become a puppet vassal state like belaruses. And the third option is to either join NATO or to get some security assurance from the west, which probably won't happen because I don't know if there is the political support for it. Those are the only three options ahead. For all the conservatives and everybody else that cried about, like, potential world war three or all that shit or whatever. Remember, the argument has always been, from an intelligent person, that allowing Russia to act unimpeded in their little conquesting is. That's the thing that moves you closer to nuclear war or World War III. Allowing Ukraine to defend itself doesn't. But if Ukraine is s not allowed to defend itself and they're not allowed to join NATO, then Ukraine should just pursue nuclear weapons because it's the only way to ensure security for your state, and you should support that. If you're opposed to helping Ukraine, you should support them getting nuclear weapons because you're probably opposed because you heard some dipshit called Mearsheimer or some idiot parroting him like Dave Smith makes some type of, like, real politik argument or something where it's like, well, countries will defend themselves and they do what they do. It's like, okay, well, then fine, then Ukraine should just get nuclear weapons. This seems to be the only thing they can do. Yeah. U okay, can you name all nuclear nations? No, I don't think so. I think it's the US. I think it's. Is it France, great Britain? Brit, was there anywhd else in Europe? I think it's the US. France, great Britain? I think Israel. Yes, I think India and Pakistan. And then did I say Russia? And then I think China. Right. Nuclear weapons countries. Let's see how many. The US, Russia, the UK, France and China. And then India, Pakistan and North Korea. Yeah, I think I got them more. Right? Israel does, too. More. Oh, yeah. Okay. They just don't follow o oh, we did get them all. Are you forgetting North Korea? Oh, I didn't say North Korea, actually. No, wait. I didn't say North Korea. I didn't think North Korea had nuclear, um, do they, have they, have they gotten all of the, they've done, like, all the enrichment to make the warheads and everything? Have they already gotten that? I know that they've been, I know that they're, like, in the process doing it. I don't know if they had all of them maybe they already have. Yeah, Israel has them. Israel definitely has. Israel definitely think they have the launch vehicles and the nuclear warheads. Nuclear warheads are the easy part. Reliable ICBM's are the harder part. That's what all the testing memes in the news over the last decades have been about. Is that true? I thought that enriching uranium. I shouldn't talk about this. A chat. Hold on. I'm sorry. Most okay, this is not. We'll read on this later. My current understanding uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons isn't hard per se, but it requires a whole bunch of infrastructure that can usually be seen in space or through other OBS observational means. So you need a lot of infrastructure, a lot of centrifuges or whatever to enrich uranium to make it weapons grade capable. ICBM's are just shooting rockets but I guess to have it be accurate. Everything else, I guess that is what North Korea tests all the time are. The ICBM part is harder. Assuming youre allowed to make the enriched uranium. I guessk hear right wing people say that Ukraine should negotiate peace by giving up land. But I cannot imagine any gun toting right wing person ever giving up a portion of their house if somebody broke in. True. Why are right wing people pro Russia, anti helping Ukraine? I would expect him to understand Castle doctrine when someone breaks stand here. Oh, for right wing people. It comes from a so progressives have like a fuck America policy and right wing people unfortunately now maybe in response to the Iraq war, have a fuck America foreign policy policy. So right wing people hate basically all american foreign policy. And part of right wing people respect Russia more than the US because Putin says based things about trans people and gay people. So they see like Russia as like having like a more pure christian strong whatever bullshit this is. In farther right circles though, and then in slightly more mainstream right circles. I don't know if this is mainstream mainstream right wing or just like kind of mainstream or like maybe Internet mainstream right wing because of people like Dave Smith. People believe, right wingers believe that the ukrainian stuff that happened in 2014, the Euro Maidan and all the protests result like a CIA backed coup basically. So they say that oh no, liken we shouldn't be involved in that because we just cooed that country anyway and it was all us driven. So. Okay, u sorry, we need. I need to at least start this now. Typ f 1979. November is the eleven month, right? October, September, November. Right? Jesus. Okay. January 20. Hi reubcome to support Ukraine and all the support it gets. I also dont buy the Americas behind Ukraine coup. Cool. But I think you might be in a minority there. Would you ever invite an adversarial to do research on a topic on stream similar of what you did with Rob Noore? If somebody. Sure, but. Oh, God, Paul's messaging me. Why did everyone shit on jaimie for being a Kingslayer when he did the objectively correct thing? Because he'your. I mean, you're still a backstabber. Okay. We would call this a conflict. A minor conflict. Major conflict. Minor conflict. The first rest we'll use, we'll just grab the Wikipedia accessed on we don't need arm. July 10, 2024. Jamie was a part of Ares Kingsguard barristan Selmia was pardoned and still retained his honor during robert rebellion.\\n\\nD: I was fucking muted. How's it going, buddy?\\n\\nDestiny: Pretty good. What's up?\\n\\nD: U? Yeah, I was wondering if u. So I started, like, doing, like I said I would do last night. I'm trying to take notes as I go through the Finkelstein.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. If you're really genuinely taking notes, you should write down points made by all sides. That would be very interesting at the end to see what points. Okay, but I'm sorry.\\n\\nD: Okay. I have been. I was just kind of doing it to see if there were. And, like, I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you in the first hour, I took many notes, but I was really just writing down things that I thought might be substantive critiques that were offered by Finkelstein.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: And I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you I found a bunch. But I definitely, you know, just to let you know, like, I'm trying in good faith to say what I. I would do. I was live for, like, 13 hours. Fucking yesterday was crazy, butmm. I watched an hour of it, and I started a little document that I'll share with you someday.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: We'll talk about it, if that's cool. But. Yeah, no, I just saw you kind of, like, I was watching your stream a little bit. You know, you were talking about, like, meth and stuff like that. I'm not like, well, I have read all theory on meth, but, you know, I did grow up in, like, a place where there was a lot of meth and stuff. But I don't know. You know, it was an interesting talk. You were having some. I saw you didn't have anybody on, so I thought I'd just, like, throw it out there.\\n\\nDestiny: Oh, well. What's up? What do you want to talk about?\\n\\nD: I don't know, man. Do you do? Would you like to talk about, likem some another issue that contentious while we have this, like, Finkelstein thing on the sideb burner while I'm doing my thing on it?\\n\\nDestiny: You know, I mean, if you want to. Sure. I usually. Yeah, I just o research stuff. Yeah.\\n\\nD: So two of my most contentious positions when I'm arguing and stuff are probably, like, guns and gun control and, like, my kind of, like, wild ideas for how to make the Internet a useful place for, like. Because I believe, like, the Internet has in a large way, like, replaced the public space in terms of, like, where people get on their soapbox and shit.\\n\\nDestiny: Right, yeah, for sure.\\n\\nD: But I think. But I think that it's very different from that soapbox public space. Right. And I have some wild kind of crazy ideas that'll probably never happen, but I think they'd be interesting, if implemented, to maybe make this space more useful for people.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, so I don't know which one.\\n\\nD: Of those sounds more interesting to you, but we could go down the gun route or the Internet route.\\n\\nDestiny: How about the.\\n\\nD: Or if you have a topic that you'd rather do, you know, I'm down for whatever, bro.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, I typically, usually people come to me with disagreements. Otherwise, I just, like, read and research stuff.\\n\\nD: So today, you want, like, a disagreement and things.\\n\\nDestiny: O. I'm just saying that. I'm just saying ordinarily, that's how my conversations are structured. Otherwise, your stuff, like I said, I'm.\\n\\nD: A casual fan guy, so I'm. But, um. Okay, so a disagreement. This is more like, kind of like a, just a nitpick, I think. U hu, but, like, we could. Maybe you'd want to talk about it. So, one of the things that I've said in the past about you and I, like, I think a lot of people probably dug through my social media looking for me being, like, a hater guy or whatever, and I really haven't been that to you, but, um, one of the things that I have said about you in the past was I was watching, like, and I don't want to bring up a sore spot, the con of, like, recent divorce arc thing. Right.\\n\\nDestiny: You can bring up whatever you want. I'm o. I just don't.\\n\\nD: I know I'm a divorce, a and I know it's, like, a tender subject for some people, so I just want to make sure you were cool with it.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm a twist of what?\\n\\nD: Oh, shit, man. Well, you got two under your belt. I got one. Yeah. So you had a very kind of, like, public type of relationship, even prior to your divorce, as I understand it, not public in terms of, like, you publishing everything, but it was very common for people that you had sexual trysts with or whatever to become known in the community or vice versa. Right.\\n\\nDestiny: That is a perception, but it is very not true if somebody did have sex, but the vast majority of people that I have relationships with or sexually interact with are completely unknown. Yeah, but obviously the perception, if you hear somebody like, oh, shit. Like, then you think, yeah, but yeahay.\\n\\nD: There'S, I mean, like, for. From my, like, obviously allotting to the casual fan thing, from my perspective, you fucked way more like fans than I ever have. Right. Or ever would, probably, but that's, like, my personal proclivities, but yeah. Right, so those are very messy things sometimes. Like, the Lav arc was very messy. I don't think you fucking lav was really at the center of that arc, if I understood it correctly. I think it was more about her alliance with the Mister girl dude. Right. And him kind of like writing this whole fucking retarded manifesto about you being some sort of a rapist because you have sex with people willingly. Like, I don't know. That's what it seemed like. That's the center of that arc was. But it was very messy, like. And there was a lot of, like, stuff that would have been embarrassing, I think, for anybody to have to talk about publicly. Right. But that's part of your job.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure, yeah.\\n\\nD: And it was weird to me because I saw you one day during that whole kind of, like, divorce arc where you were talking with your fans and you were giving them this very earnest advice about drama and shit. And I was like, what is the disconnect there? Because your life is way more dramatic, at least publicly. Right.\\n\\nDestiny: I'm a Sen. Public figure who lives an exceptional life. Right.\\n\\nD: Yes, yes, that is true. That is true. Yeah. Do you feel like that you're, like, equipped to give people advice on having a healthy, sustained relationship?\\n\\nDestiny: Far more than 99% of people that talk about on the Internet. Yeah, absolutely. Okay.\\n\\nD: Yeah. It's just strange to me, like, that we could dig into that, right? I'm not claiming that I'm an, like, I've just told you I'm a devorce, say, but I have a very, like, I don't know, the kids call it a body count today, right. I've been with four people my entire life, but all four of those were really long term relationships, like five years or more. And my personal proclivities are not the same. As yours in terms of. I don't judge people. You fuck who you want. As long as it's a consenting adult, how are you want in my book? Right. I'm not a prude, but personally, I'm not attracted to, like, that kind of, like, casual sex thing. It's just never been my thing.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: And it seems like that, that is at the root that plus you having a very vibrant community has been at the root of a lot of, like, probably unnecessary drama in your past. Right? Like, when I say unnecessary, I mean drama that, like, if you could go and excise it from your fucking history, you probably would because it would only. You make you look better to normies. Right?\\n\\nDestiny: No, I think that having a. I think doing a variety of content has always been, like, a big strength for my content. Ever since I started vivance, I think my proclivity for some of the more dramatic or exciting stuff has decreased. But, I mean, like, it's been, it's definitely been a huge strength of my content.\\n\\nD: Yeah, he's only got forward his age. He's come cooked. Yeah. Sorry. Chat, like. Yeah, I don't. But bet, you know, I've been in a really long term relationships. I have a lot of, like, relationship stuff, but ye, I haven't fuck, I haven't run through like 90 people and that's, that's cool in my book. I don't know. So. But, yeah, no, I, I mean, like, I, like I said, I didn't know that you typically like what we, what I would do is come in pretty heavy contention with you. I'm just like, you know, I've said this before privately in the stream that we talked about yesterday where I said, you know, about Finkelstein saucing on you. You look earlier in that a bunch of times I said, you know, I really enjoyed our talk. And that's true. Like, I had a good time talking to you.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay. Yeah, it's fun to argue and. Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nD: So that, that was all, you know, that's why I kind of threw it out there to you today. I wanted to ask. I guess. I guess I could. Do you have any, like, u tips for getting through this fucking thing? Because it's a bit of a slog for me. No, it's, it's not on your end. I'm just saying, like, the whole, whole thing, like, a five hour discussion of this type is not the typical kind of content.\\n\\nDestiny: I mean, it's a boring, I mean, it's a boring, it's a boring long to be put it on times too. I don't know what else, but I.\\n\\nD: Think it's important because I want, like, you, you reached out to me in good faith yesterday, you know, to ask me about a take I had publicly about you. Right. And I said I would do it. And I feel like it's important for me to at least make good on that, even if we don't come to the same agreement or whatever. But you don't. So I'm doing it. I just wondering if you have any.\\n\\nDestiny: Like, the only thing, here's the thing. Here's the thing that I wish that people would, would do. I don't care if people are right or wrong on things. I just wish people had an appropriate level of conviction. So if somebody were to say, what did you think about the debate between x and Y? And let's say somebody hadn't watched it all and then saying like, oh, I actually don't know. I didn't watch it. I saw like a five minute clip and it looked like this. But, you knowah, that was my feelings on the, that I saw.\\n\\nD: That would be like, you're right about that. Like I should have said to that question. And I will tell you if you go back and watch, I'm not saying you have to sit through my stream. I know it's probably not the type of content, but, like, go back to that content. It very, it's very much about like rapid fire q and a, kind of like a bunch of chat. I've done it for fucking like a long time. It's, it's just a hobby of mine. I have this incessant need to talk, and I can't really alleviate that need in my personal life without it being a problem. People don't like being talked to as much as I like to talk.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure.\\n\\nD: And so that's what I was doing there. But, yeah, I do regret that I didn't say, you know, yeah, I've watched a good chunk of, like, I don't know how long it is, but I've watched, you know, 23 minutes of that.\\n\\nDestiny: Right, sure do. Okay, wait, so what, you brought up like three different topics. Did you, was there anything here you wanted to talk about or any things you brought up before? Because we have disagreements or whatever. You mentioned the drama stuff. You mentioned the relationship stuff.\\n\\nD: I don't know yet if we have disagreements. That's the thing is, like, I haven't heard you talk about directly much gun stuff. I know you probably have talked a bunch about it, but like I said, I'm a casual guy. I tend to see the stuff that hits the algorithm real hard and the stuff that doesn't. Maybe not, you know, and so the gun thing, maybe we got a disagreement there. The Internet thing, we maybe got a disagreement there.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, yeah. Whatever. Whatever topic you want to talk on, you just lay out your points of view and'll tell you.\\n\\nD: Agree? I'll give you the most controversial one, right? The one that gets me the most shit. So I have this three tiered Internet theory thing, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Okay?\\n\\nD: Where it's like, I think that the Internet now is functionally useless as a public space. And that mean not useless, but functionally flawed heavily as a public space for, like, good faith talking and people to espouse their opinions and have people listen like you would on a soapbox, right? Because. And one of the things that I think really undermines that is that let'let's, say I'm on my soapbox and I'm talking about how I've read all theory and people have gathered around, right? One dude in, and people are interested enough to want to hear what I have to say, right? And so they're listening, and there's one dude in the, in the audience that goes, fuck you, your fat piece of fucking garbage or whatever, and everybody kind of turns around and like, hey, let him talk. Shut up, guys. Like, no, fuck him, right? In public. Eventually, like, a motivated crowd is probably gonna give that dude the bums rush, right? They're probably gonna be like, fuck you. Get out of here. Don't you. Don't shout people down, right o. You can't do that on the Internet because that dude, if you do the Internet equivalent of that, like, time him out or bant him, right? He's back 10 seconds later is three other dudes. No, no, no. Fuck you. You know, like, there's like a. If you want. And I, like I said on my personal streams that I just do for fun and to get my weird, like, brain communicating with people, I I want that, like, chat space to not be twitch chat, where it's just memes and people trying to be as fucking wild as possible. Like, I want to try and have a conversation with people even though it's kind of one way, right? Like, when you have the video, you can be way think it's interesting, right, to try and have a chat with that. But I, like, I couldn't do it, like, with your chat or like a bigger chat, like Hassan's chat or like a twitch chat, you know?\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: And. And I think that that's kind of a problem. Like, not. Not a problem. We, like, we need to fucking ban or put people in prison for being trolls or whatever. I'm a troll. Like I have been in the past. At least it's not bad. It's just like, you know, for. There's a lot of stuff going on that's really important. So anyway, here's my prescription. I think that when you're born.\\n\\nDestiny: No.\\n\\nD: You get a Social Security number. I think you should get login credentials when you're born. Right.\\n\\nDestiny: All right.\\n\\nD: And I think when you're like age five or six, when you hit kindergarten, whatever age that is, I think it's five, right? Five or six something. Get access. You get access to what with that login credential to what I call the kindert.\\n\\nDestiny: Right, okay.\\n\\nD: And it's. This is the first tier, right. The first time you can get on the Internet, you use your little Social Security login to get to the kindert. Right. And it has stuff that's appropriate for five and six year olds, you know, Barney, the purple dinosaur and little cartoons and games that are fun to play, that are reading numbers. I can't think of a reason in my mind why six year olds or any kid below the age of fucking 18, honestly should be in the same room with a bunch of adults talking about adult shit.\\n\\nDestiny: Right, okay.\\n\\nD: So as you age up in the kindernt, you get more access to stuff. So like in the fourth grade, you start learning a little bit about civics. So you want to give a little Wikipedia access and you want to unrestrict it. But still, when it comes, like social media type stuff where you're interacting with other people, you're kind of kept as you age up within two years of what you are, you make sense. So if you're 13 and your interact.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, wait, okay, wait. Weekend for. Just because I do have other stu to it. Okay. So I probably going to largely agree with everything you'going to say, like having an age segregated Internet. I think theoretically, I would probably agree to some extent. I think the only issue I would have is the practical application. It might be really hard to do it.\\n\\nD: Yeah, but yeah, andn I wouldn't be the guy to talk to about that. I have talked to people like, and.\\n\\nDestiny: Who said that that'proably whoever said that that's probably not true. I don'think. It would require fundamentalesign of anything.\\n\\nD: Well, he was talking about a uniform adoption across the world. Unless you wanted to shut down the Internet and have like a cloistered United States Internet right. Because the rest of the world would obviously have to comply. Otherwise there would be foreign people hanging around with kids on the ke internt or whatever the fuck.\\n\\nDestiny: Right? Sure, I understand what you're saying. It would be doable technologically. It would be trivial probably, but speed it up.\\n\\nD: Cause you said you had other shit to go to do today. So the second. So once you're 18, you get access to two accounts, right? Those was unlocked. Maybe eighteen's not the age. Maybe it's 21. I'm flexible there. Whatever you think adult and can be in the room and have political discussion. I think it's 18. Cause that's when people vote. But whatever, at 18, you get two accounts, right, that unlock one of them is functionally anonymous to the public, right? You can name yourself booty butt barf 29 and troll people for a living on that account. But if you get banned, you've got two choices. Stay gone or come back on main. And your main account, your second account is gonna have, like, not docs, right, but, like, personal identifying information, a picture of you. Something that, like, proves that you are a citizen of the state that you live in. You are a us citizen so that you can't, like, gaslight and be a Russian and pretend to be an American. That's like, yes, I like Trump or whatever that shit that goes on, right? So that's. That's functionally it, right? You have one anonymous account so that, like, people can say things that they wouldn't feel comfortable with. Everybody in their social circle saying come out as gay, maybe a spouse are really an unpopular opinion politically, but, like, if they use. They've only got one other choice. Come back on Maine and let everybody see that, you know, Joe Blow from Kokomo is a douchebag moron that spends all day trolling the Internet. Or if I can clean it up and be an adult and actually have a talk and engage. Right?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I. Yeah. Like I said, I don't think I even necessarily disagree in theory. It would just be the application, the practice would be. I don't think anybody would. It'd be hard to get people on board with it because people just say you're making chinese Internet or you're giving the government, like, ultimate control the Internet and.\\n\\nD: Right.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, but, yeah, I don't think I necessarily.\\n\\nD: I mean, the government likes. Functionally, as far as I understand, it has ultimate purview over people that use the Internet, especially within the United States. Unless you think Snowden made up a bunch of shit somebody. Okay, so I'm not saying that like was Snowden S. Snowden's kind of like whistle blowing and his book, right? He talks very, in a very detailed manner about what the surveillance state is capable of and the picture that he paints and maybe you have bit different understanding is a surveillance state that's largely asleep at the wheel because it's doing passive metadata collection on everybody, right? And so it's not like there's some analyst sitting there looking at the destiny file all day watching everything you say, right? But if your name were to come up in some sort of federal investigation, that information could be pretty easily accessed according to what Snowden said.\\n\\nDestiny: Sure, accessing the data, but like putting restrictions and stuff. There's a big difference between like reading stuff versus being able to write stuff. But if you actually wanted to like implement thisle legislation this would be trivial to do probably at the ISP level, right? The ISP's would just gate people's access to the Internet based on some credentials and then you would just do it that way basically, right?\\n\\nD: I mean functionally what I would like to happen is for parents to take more accountability for what their children are doing online because I think it's super simple to set up basic child prooofing on a phone or at the fucking switch level, you know what I mean? Like'it's not hard. There are YouTube videos that will like literally hold your hand like you're a monkey and walk you through it.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, I think at this point, unfortunately, I think when we were kids I think it was fair to say that parents need to be careful with their kids are accessing on the Internet. But these days it's so easy for kids to find Internet devices. I think it's almost impossible. Like if Nathan would get in trouble and we would like ban him from the computer for a while, like his friends at school would like make logins on their laptops and shit for him or would like let him use their phones and stuff log into account. It'like impossible to like how the fuck do you even begin to. Or even like his iPad. It's like really difficult to control at that point.\\n\\nD: Right, but you knew about it so you could follow up with him, right? Like stop that, right? You could like, like.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, I mean I doubt we know all about it. We only know about like what? Like I've got Nathan to talk to me about.\\n\\nD: Yeah, he was sneaky with it then.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, he's very sneaky. Yeah, but I think most kids probably are like as soon as they start.\\n\\nD: In your household I imagine that you had a reasonable idea what Nathan was doing.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah. In the household it's very easy physically but I mean like once they go.\\n\\nD: To school I feel like that's not true of. I feel like that's not true of most people your age who are parentsh sure.\\n\\nDestiny: Well, but I mean like to be fair, even in the household when it comes to Internet stuff. So for instance, a really popular game I don't think Nathan'understand anyere it used to be is roblox. But the problem is as soon as you start talking about games like that, other people can be in chat rooms like saying and doing weird stuff and chatting with your kid and like y. There's no real way unless you getate your kid from like all Internet video games as well. It's like. It's impossible to.\\n\\nD: Yeah, you know, I'm not a parent but I have like very strong like prescriptions when it comes to kids. I worked in education for eight years, not as a teacher, but it was my job to set up the technology end of common Core and I was. My title was network systems administrator. It just meant I was the dude that did all the donkey ran the server blades and shit.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nD: And so I was very passionate while I was there because I saw the sorry state of education and I was actually working at. I worked for eight years in the district that I grew up in. So I had like a very functional view of the degradation of education.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: And so I have a very strong feeling about not just like our duty to children, to give them a good baseline education as a public education that's free and provides for their needs. Right. But also for parents to take responsibility because I don't care how good a school is, if you're a fuck off parent, your kid's gonna suck, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Probably, yeah.\\n\\nD: But you know, I don't have children, so I'm not trying to like judge people whose kids suck. I know sometimes kids for reasons that are outside of your control. But you know, most of the time, even in those cases, I feel like good parenting would counter a lot of the social ills that come from having a kid that didn't have a good parenting.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nD: So that's kind of like when it comes. When it comes to like our duty educationally to children, I feel like I'm pretty judgmental of parents that just hand their kid an iPad and go like, what am I supposed to do? You know? And I feel like that is a lot of that.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nD: In public. And I'm starting to see, like, the degradation of child, children's ability to, like, communicate. You know, like when I was working at the school, it was odd to me how little they talked to each other. There were a lot of kids just on their phone, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Sure. 24/7 so, yeah, I think that phone are, like, one of the few things, and, like, social media, one of the few things that I think we. I.\\n\\nD: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I agree.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay.\\n\\nD: Completely agree. And I think a hyper focus on, like, any kind of ideological issue over just a broad general education is such a disservice to kids. Right. Going either direction.\\n\\nDestiny: Right, sure. But I mean, they can play with each other hand in hand. It's hard to separate them sometimes, right?\\n\\nD: Yes. Yeah, it is very hard. But I do think it can be done reasonably right without trampling on the rights of kids to learn about things outside of their parents perspectives. I'm just saying, like, for me, I'm very utilitarian when it comes to education. I think in America, if we're going to keep the system the way it is, education should be about prepping you to go to college or a trade school. Right. You don't not have collegeism for everybody, but prepping you to kind of, like, know what direction you want to walk in because you're now an adult and you go to jail forever if you fuck up too bad, you know? So, like, and if it doesn't do that, and I feel like it's not meeting that standard in a lot of places, in most places in America, I would feel comfortable saying it's not meeting that standard.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, maybe. Yeah, ye.\\n\\nD: You know, like, we could talk about charter schools and private schools. Like, I have probably different feelings on those. I mean, I, I've had some experience with them and I feel like they're pretty based sometimes when they're done. Right. Like, Texas really blew my mind when I moved to Texas from California. I lived there for three years. My girlfriend at the time had a little sister that was in high school, and she got into a charter high school that was about performing arts on big theater. Dork. So I was like, whoa. Like, I wouldn't even think that something like that would be in Texas. You know, with the kind of California attitude. You know how California and Texas are constantly arguing about who's shittier and we're both shitty, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Maybe.\\n\\nD: Yeah, I'yeah, I mean, that's how I feel.\\n\\nDestiny: But anyway, it's funny going to Austin, though, because the people in Austin are pretty similar to people in LA, at least if you're like, yeah, I lived.\\n\\nD: In on the very edge of San Antonio, in a little town called Windcrest. And we went to Austin all the time. And Austin was like. It was weird. It was like a little like Calif. Like. Like a Laguna beach with no water. Dropped in the middle of Texas for some reason. Right? Like there's a giant bucky'one. Mile outside of the town. Like the most texas thing ever, and then you're in California. So a lot of people have a lot of misconceptions. Those were definitely challenged when I lived and traveled in Texas. I was like, whoa, this state is way more complex than my, like, upbringing and general knowledge of it had led me to believe. Right? Yeah, I think California is the same way. Like, I was raised in a deep, deep red, heavy Trump district. I live there now. I still live in Fresno, California, right, in the Central Valley. And, you know, I think a lot of people think about California. They think, like, beaches and hippies and what you knowe, and it's there is that there's a lot of that shit, but there's also a lot of deep red fucking chaw backy spitting, fucking good old boy. White guys don't like nothing brown.\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, there's a. Yeah, there's all types out thereeah.\\n\\nD: Why is heing so much? Isn't that what you do when you go on a show? Do you want me to just sit here and go?\\n\\nDestiny: No, we app here. I do need that. There's stuff I got to read, though, for. I've got a show coming up in an hour, half as well, so I'm gonna start.\\n\\nD: Yeah, no worries, man. I didn't have any focus thing, but I'll hit you up when I've got that whole Finkelstein thing watched and we'll have a more focused topic, right?\\n\\nDestiny: Yeah, sure. Sounds good.\\n\\nD: All right, buddy. Thanks, man.\\n\\nDestiny: A good one. Bye.\\n\\nD: Good luck. Bye.\\n\\nDestiny: Okayz. All right. Sorry. Okay. Let's just see how far we can run this down. I think I got about an hour. The iranian hostage crisis. I was trying to find leaders for Iran at this time, but I forgot that other countries kind of change in how they do leadership structure, so I don'even. Know who the leader of Iran or if it would even would have been a speme carard at the time, like who this is. Somebody said a VPN would destroy the entire ISP idea. All VPN's can do are encrypt traffic from one source to another. But if the. If the ISP requires some sort of login to even like access the ISP network? I dont think you can get around that or there would be no way to get around that with a VPN. I dont think VBN's cant do everything. Okay. Was an argo about the iranian hostage crisis? I have no idea. Fuck. Any more instrumental music the iranian hostage crisis was a diplomatic standoff between Iran and the United States. 53 american diplomats and citizens were held hostage in Iran after a group of armed iranian college students belonging to the muslim student followers of the imam'line who supported the iranian revolution, including Hossin Defan or dean, the future iranian minister of defense, Mohammad Ali Jafari, the future Revolutionary Guards commander in chief and Mohammad Bagiri, future chief of the General Staff of the iranian army, took over the us embassy in Tehran and took them as hostages. Hostages were held for 444 days from November 4, 1979 to they release on January 20, 1981. The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of the Iran United States relations. So for the location we can say us embassy in Tehran. Okay, how do we. Okay, I have to find ways to set standards of behavior in chat. If I just answer the same question over and over again, I think eventually chat will learn. Okay. People ask over and over and over again, is there a reason you readings is a reason you read this? Things come up as I read things and sometimes I'm like, oh, it'd be nice to know about this. Or I'd like, oh, I'll look this up later. Well, this month I'm writing a note and I'm going to do a thing on it on every single subject. Okay, so the iranian hostage negotiations, the egyptian fatwa that apparently Sadat had for peace, brief history of NATO and expansion, maybe something more detailed on the Ukraine Russia war, the Nixon Watergate scandal, Biden's quid. These are all things where I'm creating notes on. All of these things are gonna be things we're creating notes on. Okay. I don't know. Every single time I'm gonna learn anything on this stream, it's gonna be like, why are you doing this? Why are reading? There's not usually a read, there's not a particular debate. There' 'nothing I'm preparing for. Just want to expand our information. Okay. Okay. Western media described the crisis as an entanglement, a vengeance and mutual incomprehension. Oh, wait, hold on. Actually for Iran. So we can say that the group behind this was essentially the muslim student followers of the imams line. Okay. I don't know if the three names listed are important people. I guess they're listed, head of the article and they've got their own article, so why not? Muhamd Ali Jafari, host ##ain dan and Mohamd Buagarii. Is that really d e h g h a n? Yeah, it is. Western media described the crisis as an entanglement of vengeance and mutual incomprehension. US President Jimmy ##ter called the hostage taking an act of blackmail and the hostage victims of terrorism and anarchy in Iran. It was widely seen as an act against the US and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the iranian revolution and its long standing support of the Shah of Iran, Mohamd Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979 after Shah Pahlavi was overthrown. Palavi or Palavi? Palavi. It must be Palavi, right? 60 minutes rewind. The Shah of Iran savors the power and the worldwide attention his oil has brought him. Unlike most autocratic leaders name. As his ambition and his military muscle have grown, so is his willingness to talk to foreign reporters. 60 Minutes made its yearly pilgrimage to the shah's palace in Tehran to canvass the royal views on assorted topics. Among them are presidential election. He clearly favors Ford, though he will not say so publicly. He thinks Carter fails to fully comprehend Iran's role in the defense of american interests on the Middle east. The shah is committed to a secure state of Israel, but he insists the Israelis must give back the arab lands they conquered in 1967. And he believes the jewish lobby in the United States helps breed israeli transsigence on that matter. In fact, he says american presidents and presidential candidates are too quick to do the bidding of the jewish lobby. Surely, your majesty, you're not telling me that the jewish lobby in the United States pulls the strings of the presidency. Not entirely, but I think even a.\\n\\nE: Little too much even for Israel interests.\\n\\nDestiny: They don't say his name. Seriously, say his name. 60 minutes. Rewind. Chances are your car is sat in your garage a driveway this weekend and chances are that your local gas station.\\n\\nE: Is going to be closed a lot.\\n\\nDestiny: More Sundays this winter. What part does the arab oil Andb Barbo play in all of this? One Milil east monarch thinks that you're being sold good the goods to try to understand something of the background of the oil shortoyage a 60 minutes crew. We spent the last three weeks in the Middle east in Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two largest oil exporting countries in the worldor and Saudi Arabia is doing work. But in Iran earlier this week we went to see the man who runs that country and in effect, its oil industry. Sh Mohamd Upavi is not an Arab. He makes a point. Palavi. Is that what he called him? We went to see the man who runs that country and in effect, its oil industry. R. Palavi is not Rita Palavi. Okay, Palavi. Palavi. What did I call him? He's Palavi. Okay. Was overthrown. Overthrow his. After Shah Palavi was overthrown, he was granted asylum and admitted to the US for cancer treatment. The new iranian regime demanded his return in order to stand trial for the crimes he was accused of committing against Iranians during his rule through his secret police. These demands were rejected, which Iran saw as us complicity in those abuses. The US saw the hostage taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, which granted diplomats immunity from arrest and made diplomatic compounds involuble. The Vienna Convention, I think is part of this, is what it just said it here. But I think it spells out like the creation of embassies and all of this and the treatment that's supposed to extend to people that are diplomats and all this bullshit as well. Talks about declaring diplomatic staff as Persona non gratas so they have to get the fuck out. How to deal with diplomatic missions. You can't see shit from these people. Communications between diplomats and their home country, stuff like that. Which granted diplomats immity from arrest to made diplomatic compounds invub. Invubable. Inviolable. Inviolable. Inviolable. The Shah left the US in December of 1979 and was ultimately granted asylum in Egypt, where he died from complications of cancer at the age of 60. On July 86, american diplomats who had evaded capture were rescued by a joint CIA canadian effort on January 27, 1980. The crisis reached a climax in early 1980 after diplomatic negotiations failed to win the release of the hostages. Carter ordered the us military to attempt a rescue mission, Operation Eaglelaw, using warships that included the USS Nimitz and the USS Coral Sea. This is an aircraft carrier right now. This isn't. Is it midway class? Oh, they're both aircraft carriers. Okay. Which were patrolling the waters near Iran. The failed attempt on April 24, 1980, resulted in the death of one iranian civilian and the accidental deaths of eight american servicemen after one of the helicopters crashed into a transport aircraft. There's a. What is the name of the big waterway? It's not the Red Sea, is it? Is that. What's the name of the big waterway between Iran and Saudi Arabia? Wait, it is right? Is it Google maps the strait. Hormuz is just. It's a little straight. I. Right. This is. Okay, so the Red Sea is here. No o, I'm sorry. We're on the south of Saudi Arabia. This between Africa. Okay, Red Sea, Gulf of Aidn. Okay. This is the Persian Gulf. And then this is the Gulf of Oman. Why does Oman get the naming rights to the whole thing? This little area right here is the Strait of Hormuz, I think. I don't know where the label is for it, but. Okay, so Persian gulf, Gulf of Oman. I wonder how deep an aircraft carrier can get here. Like how deep this water is all probably super deep. Like deep enough for any ship like that. And this area probably is too, maybe, I would imagine. Oh, there it is. US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned his position following the failure. September of 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, beginning the Iran Iraq war. These events led the iranian government and negotiations with the US, with Algeria acting as a mediator. I wonder what's in terms of like leaders in the United States for a military conflict, for conflicts like these. Is it. I feel like knowing the State Department person is kind of important. Do you think? It feels like. It feels like in past stuff for the United States, like people like Kissinger, like your secretaries of state were like really important people. But I feel like recently I feel like you don't hear as much about them. Am I. Do you think I'm wrong in that or am I crazy? Why does it feel like secretary of are not as important anymore? I guess they were because people blame Hillary for Libya and shit. Huh. U okay, so under Jimmy Carter, the secretary of state was Cyrus Vance. When did he resign? April 28, 1980. Actually he should go on another list of secretaries of state. The national security Adv is more important than secretary of state. They just have the policy. I feel like I never hear about the national security advisors much. I don'I'll. Just write it down just in case. Maybe I'll include them later. Okay, so he left here. Warren Christopher for four days. Okay. Based David Newsom for one day. Richard and Cooper for zero days. This guy for one day. Christopher again for four days. Jesus, what happened? Okay, then through January 18, 1981, probably right before the new administration came in. Huh? Political analysts decided the standoff as a major factor in the continuing downfall of Carter's presidency and his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election. The hostages were formally released into the United States custody the day after the signing of the Algiers accords, just minutes after American President Ronald Reagan in Iran. The crisis strengthened the prestige of Ayatollah Ruhollah Komeni and the political power of theocrats who opposed any normalization of relations with the west. The crisis also led to american economic sanctions against Iran, which further weakened ties between the two countries. Oay, I'll write this down here tentatively. So big takeaways would be. Let's see, I'll wr this for now. We'll say significantly deteriorated US Iran relations, considered a major contributor to Carter's presidential downfall. That was spelling correctly. Okay, we'll have this there for now. Let's see. Lead up 1953 coup at what a word? During the second World War, the british and the soviet governments invaded and occupied Iran, forcing the first Palavi monarch, RZ Sha Palavi. Palavi. That was his name, right? Pahlavi. To abdicate in favor of his eldest son, Muhammad ra reza Palavi. Bro. Why the similar ish names? Christ. The two I know is Etat. Jesus. The two nations claimed that they acted preemptively in order to stop rize Shah from aligning his petroleum rich country with Nazi Germany. However, the Shah's declaration of neutrality and his refusal to allow iranian territory to be used to train or supply soviet troops probably the real reasons for the invasion. Iran. Okay. The United States did not participate in the invasion, but it secured Iran's independence after the war ended by applying a tense diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union, which forced it to withdraw from Iran. From Iran in 1946. By the 1950s, Mohamd Reza Palavi was Mohammad Mossadee, an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty. Mo Moadee Mosadee led a general strike demanding an increased share of the nation's petroleum revenue from the Anglo Iranian oil Company which was operating in Iran. The UK retaliated by reducing the amount of revenue which the iranian government received. Better source needed. In 1953, the CIA and Mi six helped iranian royalist depose Mosade deg in a military coup'at, codenamed Operation Ajax, allowing the shah to extend his power. For the next two decades, the Shah reigned as an absolute monarch. Disloyal elements within the state were purged. The US continued to support the shah for the coup with Sai training the iranian secret police. In the subsequent decades of the cold war, various economic, cultural and political issues united iranian opposition against the shah and led to his eventual overthrow. Mosade Dec. Mosade Dec. Okay, so background stuff. After World War Two, do you think Russia would really start a nuclear war if it loses? I don't know. Depends on what you mean by lose. I know the name because Michael Brooks would bring him up once per show. Oh, nice. Listen, it sounds really mean to say this, and I don't mean it as a mean way, but. My God, bro, if Brooks were alive for this whole Israel palestinian conflict. My God. Okay. After the second world war, um. I don't think I even have anything on you. The USSR Union of. Is that the formal name includes government in it. Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, briefly. Let's see. Let's see. We'd say briefly, occupied Iran. The US forced the Soviets to withdraw in 1946. This means it on app. The 1950s, the British and United States Mi six and CIA assisted Shah in a coup det operation Ajax. Wow. Hardcore youting eon Bette soon. I don't know. I need to, like, reach out to me, like, even have a subject debate. I think we tweeted back and forth. I think he agreed. We just haven't. I don't even think I've. I didn't tweet him to even follow up on the thing after I got back from my travel. Am I six? I think I have articles on any of these things. The military intelligence section six or the secret intelligence service. What is like the actual. What do we call this? What do you guys call it? It's mi six. So we'll say military intelligence section six. My article for that. Central Intelligence Agency. Um, okay, pretty sure this is a very famous. What I just call this the iranian revolution. Islamic revolution. What is called a. Okay, wait. Yes. Okay, the shot at the time was this palavi guy, right? Yes. Okay. Jesus. 19. Or, wait. The United States continued to back the shah for the next two decades. Okay, background Carter administration. No, wait, hold on. I think I just fuck this up. Wait. This 1953 coup is not. When people talk about the iranian revolution. They're not talking about that one. They're talking about the one in 79. When you talk about the, um. You would just call this the 1953 co. Okay, Jesus, fuck me. Hold on. Do they have a name for this one? Nop. Okay. 1953 Iran coup. Okay, this is just the lead up to the thinking. 79. Okay. Carter administration. Months before the iranian revolution. On New Years'eve of 1977, US President Jimmy Carter further angered antish Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi, claiming that the shah was beloved by his people. After the revolution commenced in February of 1979, with the return of the Ayatollah Khomeni, the american embassy was occupied and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy front facing windows that they were replaced with bulletproof glass. The embassy staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly 1000. Earlier in the decade, Carter administration tried to mitigate anti american feeling by promoting a new relationship with the de facto iranian government and continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize. Interesting. So de facto government, so what? They hadn't actually, after the revolution commenced in February of 79 with the return of the ayatollah, the american. Okay, a new relationship with the de facto. Okay. So they taken over the ayatollah, okay, it's tooum manyi. Not tooum manyi or komeni. Stop. Komeni. Ayatollah komeeni. That's my guess. That's my best friend.\\n\\nD: Fuck.\\n\\nDestiny: Okay, wait. I think we tried to look up his pronunciation. We couldn't find anybody. O al Jazeera will tell. Usah Khomeini. Grand Atollah Khomeini. The architect and the face of the iranian khi. Khomeini. Aettollah Khomeini. Revolution. Obey the architect. Grand Atollah Khomeini. Khomei. Khomei. Khomeini. Khomeini. Khomeini. Jesus. Ayatollah Khomeini. Okay, the american embass was okay, blah, blah, blah. The cardter administration, to mitigate anti american feeling by promoting a new relationship with the de facto government, hopes that the situation was stabilized. However, on October 22, 1979, the US permitted the shah, who had lymphoma, to enter New York Hospital Cornell Medical center for medical treatment. The State Department had discouraged this decision, understanding the political delicacy. But in response to pressure from influential figures, including former secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Council of Foreign Relations chairman David Rockefeller, the Carter administration decided to grant it. The Shahs admission to the United States intensified iranian revolutionaryes anti americanism and spaw rumors of another us backed coup that would reinstall him. Khomeini, who had been exiled by the shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the great Satan, as he called the US, talking of evidence of american plotting. In addition toing what they believed was american sabotage of the revolution, hostage takers hoped to depose the provisional revolutionary government of Prime Minister Mehi Bazarn, which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the US and extinguish islamic revolutionary order in Iran. The occupation of the embassy on November 4, 1979, was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the Shah to stand trial in Iran in exchange for the hostages. A later study claimed that there had been no american plots to overthrow the revolutionaries and that a CIA intelligence gathering mission at the embassy had been notably ineffectual, gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language, Persian. Its work, the study said, was routine, prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere. Let's see. After the iranian revolution in 1979, the embassy was briefly occupied with its staff hostage. And then, let's see. The Carter administration allowed the shah to come to the US for medical treatment, angering the new de facto government in Iran, which publicly declared that the US. That the US was planning on assisting the shah in another. Cool. Okay, okay. So these are the events leading up to this. Oay for the first attempt. On the morning of February 14, 1979, the Organization of Iranian People's Fedadai guerrillas stormed the us embassy in Tehran and took a marine named Kenneth Kraus hostage. Ambassador William H. Sullivan surrendered the embassy to save lives and with the assistance of iranian foreign Minister Ibrahim Y. Y. Yatsi, Yastdi returned to the embassy to us hands within 3 hours. Kraus was injured in the attack. Kidnapped by the militants, tortured, tried and convicted of murdered. He was to be executed. But President Carter and Sulan secured release within six days. The incident became what? When you talk about like a foreign minister, the foreign minister usually remains in the host country. They don't live at the other embassy. Right. So like our iranian foreign minister is proably would live in the United States and then foreign ministers work in the State Department, is that correct? Do I have most of that right? I think so. Hmm. First and second, would these still be like lead ups or. No, fuck it. We'll call them Yazidi. Is that how you pronoun his name? February or no. February 14, 1979 the organization of blah blah blah blah blah stormed the us embassy and took a marine hostage. 'least six days later, us pressure. And then the second attempt. Foreign minister is just a minister based in the homeland and flown out to or hosting diplomatic events. Okay. The next attempt to seize the american embassy was planned for September 1979 by Ibrahim or Ibrahimim Asgarzade. As Garzade. Asgarzade. Asgarzade. Fuck me, dude. A student at the time, he consulted with the heads of the islamic associations of Tehrans main universities, including the University of Tehran, Shif University of Technology, Amrk Kir Kabir University of Technology and Iran University of Science and Technology. They named their group the muslim student followers line, as Gard later said that there were five students at the first meeting, two of whom wanted to target the soviet embassy because the USSR was a marxist. And anti God regime. Two others, Mosen Mir Damati and Habibbola Baf, supported as Garade S chosen target, the United States. Our aim was to object against the american government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours. As Garzade said, announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way. Mir Dadi told an interviewer, we intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more. Maau Ebar, the spokeswoman for the iranian students during the crisis, said that those who rejected as Garzade's plan did not participate in the subsequent events. Hold on, let me get this, guys. Jesus. We hear pronounce the name. Please just say his name right at the beginning. Today in our program, we are going to explore azerbaijani identity, azerbaijani culture and history with doctor Alza Askarzad. Askar Askars in history with doctor Ascarade Jesus, fuck me. Hopefully this guy isn't that important. Asarsade the students observed the procedures of the marine security guards from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy. They also drew on their experiences from the recent revolution, during which the us embassy grounds were briefly occupied. They enlisted the support of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. Let see. In planning the second attempt, the students observed the procedures of the marine security guards and drew from their experience during the prior revolution, also enlisted the help of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. For some reason, the. I don't know why, but the DGG shot freezes on screen and I can't even refresh it. In obs, I've got to like re add the entire element. So I just, when it freezes in Chel, just click the button, it switch over and then we'll figure it out. I think it's getting figured out. I don't know why. What's happening? Okay, let's see. According to the group and other sources, Khomein Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand. The students had wanted to inform him, but according to the author Mark Bowdin, Ayatollah Mohamd Moafi persuaded them not to do Sohia feared that the government would use the police to expel the students as they had the occupier. In February, the provisional had been appointed by Khomeini. Khomeini was likely to go along with the government's request to restore order. On the other handia knew that if he first saw it fuck me first saw that the occupiers were faithful supporters of him unlike the leftists in the first occupation and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover. It would be very hard, perhaps even impossible for him to oppose a takeover and this would paralyze the Baran administration which HIA and the students wanted to eliminate. Supporters of the takeover stated that their motivation was fear of another american backed coup against their popular revolution. U let's see takeover motivations. Okay, takeover. On November 4 19 student unions loyal to Khomeini erupted into an all out conflict right outside the walled compound housing the us embassy. At around 06:30 a.m. we should have this something bo boom takeover. This whole part first. At about 06:30 a.m. the ringleaders gathered between 300 500 selected students and briefed them on the battle plan. A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy's gates and hid them beneath her. Chador. Chador. Oh jeez. Bayed. At first, the students planned a symbolic occupation in which they would release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order. This when the EMBC guards brandished firearms the protesters were treated with one telling the Americans, we don't mean any harm. But as it became clear that the guards would not use deadly force and that a large angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to che the occupiers and jeer the hostages, the plan changed. According to one embassy staff member buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy. Shortly after the muslim student followers of the imams line broke through the gates. Wait. Okay. As Khomeini's followers had hoped, Khomeini supported the takeover. According to foreign Minister Yazidi, when he went to K to tell Khomeini about it, Khomeini told him go and kick them out. But later that evening, back in Tehran Yazzidi heard on the radio that Khomeini had issued a statement SP supporting the seizure, calling it to the second revolution and the embassy and american spy den. In Tehran, the marines and embassy staff were blindfolded by the occupiers and then paraded in front of assembled photographers. In the first couple of days, many of the embassy workers who had sneaked out of the compound or had not been there at the time the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages. Six american diplomats managed to avoid capture and took refuge in the british embassy. Can we chill over here for a sec. Our play are gonna fuck right now guys. Before being transferred in joint covert operation known as the Canadian Caper. The canadian government and the CIA managed to smuggle them out of Iran on January 28, 1980 using canadian passports and a cover story then identified them as a film crew. Others went to the swedish embassy in Tehran for three months. The State Department diplomatic cable of November 8, 1979 details a tentative, incomplete list of us personnel being held in the embassy compound. Let' so at's 06:30 a.m. on November 4, 1979. Protests protesters. The organization of some ringleaders managed to break cut in and break into the us embassy, eventually taking it over. That's probably good enough. Islamists in Iran rounded up most of the absent embassy workers and return them to the embassy, with some workers managing to take refuge in the british or british, swedish or canadian embassy. Six american diplomats were smuggled out of Iran on January 28, 1980. A joint canadian CIA operation known as the Canadian Caper. Yikes. Imagine having to ask Canada for help for anything ever. ##ay might be slugy, but heritage foundation got hacked. What? Is there anything interesting in the. In the hacked info or. Okay. Government working of all we didnt know about. I dont know about anything else. Let'see. Motivations. The muslim student followers of the imams line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi returned to Iran for trial and execution. The US maintained that the shah was to die less than a year later. Or. No, I'm sorry, I'm gonna say. Wait. What? The US maintained that the shah, who was to die less than a year later in July 1980, had come to America for medical attention. The group's other demands included the us government apologized for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran, including the overthrow of prime minister. I don't remember to say this, Mosadee in 1953, and that Iran'frozen assets in the United States be released. The initial plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time, but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support. Some attributed the decision not to release the hostages quickly to President Carter's failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran. His initial response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes for a strategic anti communist alliance with the ayatollah. As some of the student leaders had hoped. Iran's moderate prime minister Bazarn and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the takeover. There's a lot of like internal domestic politics stuff here that I don't, I don't have any understanding. The duration of the hostages captivity has been attributed to internal iranian revolutionary politics. As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran's president, this has unified our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections. Various leftist student groups also supported the taking of hostages of the us embassy. The embassy takeover was aimed at strengthening the new regime against liberal elements in the government, portraying the regime as a revolutionary force while winning over the major following the peoples mojahideen the peoples Mojah Hadideen of Iran had amongst students in Iran. This is the same thing as like, does mujah de just mean like some kind of fighter? What does this mean? Refers to people who engage in jihad. Okay. Anytime you see anything, if you ever see anything that, like in Arabic that looks similar or like the romanization of some of these words, I think you say romanization that looks so much. Usually it's the same word. They just spell it differently. Sometimes like 9900, sure, but okay. The people's Moshe Haden of Iran had among students in Iran, according to scholar Daniel Pipes, writing in 19 toward market based reforms under the late Shah. And both subsumed individualism, including the unique identity of women under conservative, though contrasting, visions of collectivism. Accordingly, both groups favor the Soviet Union over the United States. In the early months of the iranian revolution, the Soviets and possibly their allies Cuba, Libya and east Germany were suspected of providing indirect assistance to the participants of the takeover of the us embassy in Tehran. The PLO under Yasser Arafat provided personnel, intelligence liaisons, funding and training for khomeinis forces before and after the revolution and was suspected of playing a role in the embassy crisis that AlC Castro reportedly praised Khomeini as a revolutionary anti imperialist who could find common cause between revolutionary leftists and anti american Islamists. Both express disdain. Both express disdain for modern capitalism and a preference for authoritarian collectivism. Cuba and its socialist ally Venezuela under Hugo Chavez would later form Alba in alliance with the Islamic Republic as a counter to neoliberal american influence. The 1953 iranian coup is a complete lie, by the way. The shah dismissed Mosadee Mosadee and that was his constitutional right. This is just standard America bad cop. Okay, well I don't have time to dig into every single fucking thing, so. Okay. The moshahidein.org isn't just a generic group, its a specific marxist.org. i didn't say they were generic group. I'm just saying that if you see different spellings of the same type of word, it's usually the same word. It doesn't mean's the same group. Just like Mohamd can be spelled like 50 different ways and Muslim can be spelled different ways, but it doesn't mean it's referring to something different completely. It's just a different spelling of the word. Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding to buttress their claims that the US was trying to destabilize the new regime by embracing the hostage taking. Under the slogan America can't do a thing, Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism of his controversial theocratic constitution, which was scheduled for a referendum vote in less than a month. The referendum was successful, and after the vote, both leftist and theocrats continued to use allegations of pro Americanism to suppress their opponents relatively moderate political forces. That the National Front, the Grand Ayatollah Mohamd Kazim Sharrit Madari, and later president Jesus Abul Hassan Banisadar, in particular. Carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage takers led to the disempowerment and resignation of moderate figures such as bazar Bazarn. The failed rescue attempt, in the political danger of any move seen as accommodating America, delayed the negotiated release of the hostages. After the crisis ended, leftist and theocrats turned on each other, with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the left. Oh, cute. So another circumstance of extremists on both sides uniting to destroy the liberals and then eating themselves alive afterwards. Fun. Okay, let's see. So we have the takeover. So we would say that initially the demands from the students or for the. Can we just say though, can I give props? Listen, our students lock themselves in their Ivy League colleges and they fucking cry for humanitarian aid. Meaning they want, like, KFC brought in, okay? Iranian students took over a goddamn fucking embassy, okay? It's a lot more hardcore. All right. Initially, demands from the students were for the return of Muhamd Riza Ra. Rita Pallavi. It was being treated for cancer. And for the United states to apologize for meddling in Irans affairs in the 1953 coup, overthrow a of the prime minister. Mosad de destiny needs to learn the distinction between rulem making. Please tell me, Natra, what do I need to learn? The executive agencies make rules based on whatever they've been authorized to make rules on from Congress. Congress makes laws by passing legislation. What am I missing? What part of this do I not understand? Prior attempts take over. Okternal factions in Iran used the union around the hostage situation to strengthen their positions inside the country, eventually leading to the adoption of a theocratic constitution, the purging of more moderate elements after the end of the hostage crisis. You things like banning a gun. How is that different than a law? Other than the fact that it's not binding? Laws do nothing. That's the problem. Right? Let's say that. Let's say that I am in Congress, okay? And then let's say that in Congress, let's say that I pass a law, okay? And this law says that farting is illegal. All right? Okay. So I mean, like, Congress can also, as part of the law might have like a. Well, they should have like a penalty for it. They'll say, and if you get caught fighting, you get executed. Okay, Congress has passed that law, but so what? The executive has to enforce it. But enforce it how so? Usually within a particular law, if it's like a novel thing, Congress will say, like Congress is charging the executive. We are creating a new office called the Office of Fart pollution. The office can have this many people, they can use these types of tools. These are laws that we wanted, the books, and these are how they're go going to be. So now the executive has like a blueprint from Congress that they can use to implement a bunch of regulations and they can choose then how to's the, that's why you have like the two separate things. They have different jobs. Laws on their own. Do nothing. You need to enforce the laws. That's what the executive is for. See, many external players were implicated or let's see, we should say the United States claims many external players were implicated in the takeover, including the Soviets, Cuba, Libya and East Germanying. Imagine being a country called East Germany. Time is anything else? I think like either six or seven. It depends on if XQC is even coming. I think he. Is he supposed to be or. No, probably 630 or seven, I would imagine, but. Well, see, um. Okay. Documents discovered inside the american embassy support. That's probably an important thing too. Documents were taken inside the embassy selectively to portray America as planning some sort of interference with internal iranian affairs. It seems unlikely this was ever being planned or considered. Supporters of the takeover claimed that in 1953, the american embassy had been used as a den of spies from which the coup was organized. Later documents which suggested that some of the members of the embassy staff had been working with the CIA were found inside the embassy. Afterwards, the CIA confirmed its role and that of Mi six and Operation Ajax. After the Shah entered the United States, Ayatollah Khomeini called for street demonstrations. This was the. The takeover. Whatever, whatever it is. In 53 revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding in order to buttress their claims that the great Satan, the US, was trying to destabilize the new regime with the assistance of iranian moderates who were in league with the US, the documents, including telegrams, correspondence, and reports from the US State Department of the CIA, were published in a series of books which were titled documents from the us espionage Den. According to a 1997 Federation of American Scientists bulletin, by 19 55, 77 volumes of documents from the us espionage den had been published. Many of these waings are now available online. Is that worth a note? Documents from the embassy. Let's see. Iran published collections of documents found in the embassy. See in a series of books titled documents from the us espionage den. Bayed so a rule more powerful than a law because it's easier to create and the executive can force it immediately. Does the executive make the rule or does Congress? The executives make the rule, but it the 444 day crisis. For a chronological guide, see timeline of the iranian hostage crisis. Holy shit. They're dropping people out of planes. What the fuck? The hostage takers declaring their solidarity with. Blah blah blah. Um, let's see. When should I end my stream? Probably 530 maybe. Wait, hold on. Everyy back a sec. I'll leave the music playing, but I don't know if it. Its s gonna kill my shit or not. 1 second. The hostage takers declaring their solidarity with the oppressed minorities and declaring their respect for the special place of women in Islam, released one woman and two African Americans on November 19. For release, these hostages were required by their captorist old a press conference in which caathy gross and William quarries praised the revolution's aims. These were two of the released people, I guess. Yeah. X Twitter is reportedly testing a dislike button. Bay o. According to the then US United States ambassador to Lebanon, John Gunther Dean, the 13 hostages were released with the assistance of the Palestine Liberation Organization after Yasser Arafat and Abu Jihad personally traveled to Tehran to secure a concession. Interesting. The PLO in 19. This would been 1979. Okay, interesting. See, they're making the bookmarks public. Why would you make likes private and then bookmarks public or. Okay, interesting. Did we watch this? Peep the topics on the video? Nope. We havent yet. I dont know if I will. The only african american hostage not released that month was Charles a. Jones, junior, when Mo hostage, a white man named Richard Queen, was released in July of 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as multiple. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity. So the hostage takers released. What would you say? Women and minorities first. After declaring solidarity with oppressed minorities, Arafat traveled to Tehran and assisted with the release of 13 other hostages. It's kind of weird. He's in the trumped o files. Or the Trump Trump Trump of federal federal Trump Trump trumped up files. Trumped of files. Hashag on Twitter. Is this anything new? I have no fuck Trump pedophiles. Oh, hashtag on Twitter. I don't know anything about the Epstein shit. I just don't care about anything related to Epstein shit. I don't like. Miss me, please miss me so hard with that shit. I don't give a fuck if something solid doesn't come out. I just don't give a fuck. People have been overplaying that Epstein shit for so fucking long. I just super don't give a fuck if anything solid comes out. Yeah, talk to me then. Okay u I will say its funny though. All the people that didnt care about the Epstein stuff that now do or the people that did care and now dont though. But whatever. People play politics. He cares. The hostages were initially held of the embassy, but after the takers took the cue from the failed rescue mission, the detainees were scattered around Iran in order to make a single rescue attempt impossible. Three high level officials, Bruce Langen, Victor L, Tom Seth, and Mike Howland. Ouch. The only guy that didn't get his own Wikipedia entry were at the foreign ministry at the time of the takeover. They stayed there for several months, sleeping in the ministry'formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom. At first, they were treated as diplomats, but after the provisional government fell, the treatment of them deteriorated. By March, the doors to their living spaces were kept chained and padlocked. By midummer 19, the Iranians had moved the hostages to prisons in Tehran to prevent escapes or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food deliveries. The final holding area from November of 1980 until the release was the Taimur Bakir mansion in Tehran. The tamer Bactir was an iranian general, the founder of the head of SAVAK from 1956 to 96. One was dismissed. Okay, Jesus. Where the hostages were finally given tubs, showers and hot and cold running water. Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors, including the former canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, visited the hostages over the course of the crisis and relayed information back to the us government, including dispatches from Langen. Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were guests and it also stated that they were being treated with respect asar as Garzade as gare I don'remember. The leader of the students described the original plan as a nonviolent and symbolic action in which the students would use their gentle and respectful treatment of the hostages to dramatize the offended sovereignty and dignity of Iran to the entire world. In America, an iranian charge defairs I actually dontoun this. A person in charge of under serves an embassy chief OFM Miss. Okay. Ali Aga stormed out of a meeting with an american official exclaim we are not mistreating the hostages. They are being very well taken care of in Tehran. They are our guests. The actual treatment of the hostages was far different. They described beatings, theft and fear of bodily harm. Two of them, William Belk, before an angry chanting crowd outside the embassy. Others supported having their hands bound day and night for days or even weeks. Long periods of solitary confinement and months of being forbidden to speak to one another or to stand, walk or leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom. All of the hostages were threatened repeatedly with execution. Took it seriously and took it seriously. The hostage takers played russian roulette with their victims. How often would they have played russian roulette that nobody lost? One hostage, Michael Matrinko, was kept in solitary confinement for several months. On two occasions when he expressed his opinion of Ayatoll Khomeini, he was severely punished. The first time he was kept in handcuff for two weeks, and the second time he was beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks. Another hostage, US army medic Donaldman, won in a hunger strike for several weeks and two hostages attempted suicide. Steve Lauteerbach broke a water glass and slashed his wrists after being locked in a dark basement room with his hands tightly bound, he was found and rushed to the hospital by guards. Jerry Meal, a CIA communications technician, smashed his head into the corner of a door, knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash. Naturally withdrawn and looking ill, old, tired and vulnerable, me had become the butt of his guards jokes and they had rigged up a mock electric chair to emphasize the fate that awaited him. His fellow hostages applied aid and raised the alarm. He was taken to a hospital after a long delay which was caused by the guards. Otherages described threats to boil their feet in oil and cut their eyes out. Or kidnap and kill a disabled son in America and start sending pieces of him to your wife. Four hostages tried to escape and all of them were punished with stretches of solitary confinement when their escape attempts were discovered. Queen the hostage who was sent home because of was multiple sclerosis, first developed dizziness and numbness in his left arm six months before his release. At first, the Iranians misdiagnosed his symptoms as a reaction to draffes of cold air. When warmer confinement did not help, he was told that it was nothing because his symptoms would disappear soon. Over the months, the numbness spread to his right side and the dizziness worsened until he was literally flat on his back, unable to move without growing dizzy and throwing up. The cruelty of the iranian prison guards came a form of slow torture. The guards often withheld. Male telling one hostage, Charles W. Scott, I dont see anything for you mister Scott. As the hostages were taken to the aircraft that would fly them out of Tehran, they were led through a gauntlet of students, forming parallel lines and shouting Margbar Amria. Death to America. When the pilots announced that they were out of Iran, the freed hostages went wild with happiness. Shouting, cheryering. Crying, clapping and falling into one anothers arms. Oages endured um, general mistreatment as prisoners. That's not really much else to say about that. I don't know what else there. Yeah. Okay. U okay. All right, I'm gonna go shower and make sure everything set up downstairs. And. Yeah, tonight we're gonna do. I think there'll be some hopefully pretty Mimi shit with XQC hopefully. And Dan and me. And maybe even some extra. Some more extra mimi shit. We'll see. Okay. Have fun. Be careful. Stay safe.\\n\\n\""
