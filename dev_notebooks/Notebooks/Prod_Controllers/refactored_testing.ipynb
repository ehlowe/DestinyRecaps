He just makes videos, like, slurping right laing people and, like, just shitting on left laing people. Oh, this is, this. I watched this last night. This is unhinged. He just starts, like, reading a bunch of Kamala quotes, and they're not even, like, really that bad. But he's like, reading them and he's like, oh, clearly she's exhibiting an inability to put together coherent thought. I'm like, wait, what the fuck? Jason Harper. How? Algebra. You and Kamala in her background, would it be worth spending time looking into her history? Does that matter this way? I don't really care that much, but I don't know any of her background. Like, isn't she, like, fucking from Hawaii or some shit or herairents from Jamaica? I have no idea. I don't know fuck all about her. \n",
      "When referring to a Supreme Court decision, Kamala said, I think of this moment as a moment that is about great momentum. Offering words of wisdom about high speed Internet, she stated, the governor and I, we were all doing a tour of the library here and talking about the significance of the passage of time. Right. The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time in terms of what we need to, to do to lay these wires, what we need to do to create these jobs. And there is such great significance to the passage of time when we think about a day in the life of our children. During a talk in France, Kamala said, we must together. You supposed, like three minutes, like, reading the quotes. And I'm like, okay. I mean, like, these could. I mean, it's a lot different when people are speaking versus when you're just reading it off a paper. But, yeah, it's such a bizarro video. Get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go to do. Kamala is frequently repetitive, but delivers her speeches as if she is saying something profound. Maybe she believes that by being the vice president. Anything that she says is automatically amazing. People should be dazzled by her statements, like, there is no actual work necessary. Other politicians throughout history who have delivered memorable quotes must have done so simply because they were politicians. Kamala doesn't understand how thought leads to coherent statements. Thinking is actually important and, one could argue, necessary, even though many of her statements are nonsensical, simplistic, and confusing. Kamala has never apologized. She appears to have a lack of insight. If Kamala is elected president, she will be in a position of speaking for the nation. Even people who do not value precision communication may be frightened by this prospect. This brings me to item number three. As I mentioned, supporters of Kamala Harris believe that her opponents are overly critical regarding her speaking style. Who is correct in this debate? Do people have the right to criticize someone who wants to be the president for speaking incoherently? In my opinion, yes. The problem with Kamala's speaking style is significant. It's not like her critics are pointing out something common like disfluencies or occasionally losing a train of thought. Kamala is speaking in circles and then expecting people to understand what she is saying. This is worrisome, considering how a president must be able to communicate clearly. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that she is a terrible person or worse than Donald Trump, rather just that it is legitimate to criticize a person's speaking style when they are running for a job that is heavily dependent on communication. If Donald Trump had the same weakness, he would be criticized for it as well. Who is? I don't understand. Yeah, I just had no idea. I just started watching this video. I'm like, oh, interesting. I remember this guy used to, like, anal only serial killers, and he's like, a full on, like, right wing grifter sellout. Dude, the fuck? \n",

There's my Nvidia that was worth $70,000 or 70,000 more a month ago, and I didnt sell it because of the short term capital gains tax. I think I should have just sold it and bought something else. But whatever. These are my meme stocks. These are my meme children, okay? And they will foster me into a new age of wealth and then I will stop streaming forever. \n",
      "Okay, somebody said destiny. How does this work with Twitter stockholders getting paid when they went private? When you buy a stock, what you're really buying is a share, a percentage of ownership in the company, right? So when a company is, I don't know this one hot hundred percent, but when a company is publicly traded, I think that means that they make available to all the major stock exchanges the ability for people to buy and sell shares of that company. If I want to purchase a company and then I want to take that company private, I don't actually know the whole process, the paperwork and the legal process for it. But if I want to take a company private, private means that it's no longer open for public purchasing and selling of stock of shares of the company. So if you own 100 shares of a company and then somebody else buys that company and then they take it private, they have to buy you out for whatever a percentage of the ownership you have, the company of the total purchase of the company. So like, let's say that's a, let's say that there's a company that has like 100 shares and it's worth a dollars, okay. And then let's say I have 20 shares of stock of that company. Let's say somebody else comes in and they buy that company, they're like, okay, I'm gonna buy it for $200. So what will happen is, is they, if I have 20 shares, the company that I bought for dollar 20, and then they buy the company out for hundred bucks, I would get dollar because they would buy out, I'd have to sell my shares. This part of the agreement that you make when you buy and sell stock that I think if somedy, if a private seller or private buyer buys it, do they also get the right to purchase your stocks? All this is a bit more complicated because there's different classes of shares and there's different whatever, but broadly speaking, let' \n",

      "I don't know enough about, I don't think I know enough about company structure to answer that. Well, the reason why you take a company public, I think, is usually because you've reached a certain size and now you can get external investment from the market \n",
      "rather than having to go and appeal to individual investors. There's also going to be, there's also going toa be like, you have to publish documents relating to the performance of your company and a publicly traded company that you don't have to for a privately traded company. \n",
      "But why would you take it private? Again, I'm not sure. I don't know. Actually. \n",
      "Shareholders can't hold you accountable when there are none or only few. Is that true though? Like let's say that you have a private company, you've got like 50 different investors. If you were to intentionally tank the company, couldn't those investors sue you? \n",
      "You want control, you don't want the legal cost of maintain a public company. Shareholder accountability is much more public. Are there boards for private companies? Couldn't there theoretically be a board or. No, there must be. Yeah, of course. I think you can have, right. Can a private company have a board of directors? No, because a board, a board represents shareholders and stuff, right? Is it exclusively to represent shareholders or can of board? \n",
      "I guess, I guess if you're a private company with a decent amount of private investors, you could have a board that represents their interest. Maybee. Yeah, hi, what's up? Yeah, private companies can have boards. You still have shareholders in a private company. They're just not. The only difference is that the public people can't buy iteah. Why would you take a, give me a couple reasons why you think you would take a company private if it's already been public. Besides, like filing, like having public filings, \n",
      "why would you take a company? What did Elon have to gain from taking Twitter and making it private? What was, what's the point? Well, becomes your company, right? As opposed to having to share it with someone else. So if the value goes up exponentially, you're the one who solely benefits versus someone else. You don't have to have certain levels of accountability. Wait, hold on. For every single publicly traded company, all of these lack a 51% owner. Huh? Is that true or. I don't know if that's true, but I do know there's a tremendous amount of reporting and regulation that you have to do when you're a public company that you don't when you're public. Well, sure, yeah, I understand that. I know there's a public filings. Oh, no. Oh, then wait. Yeah, I don't understand why you would take, well, I mean, the amount, let me put it this way. I think to be a public company, like, let's just say you're an OTC shitter garbage company that does nothing but say that you're public on the pink sheets, it's probably about million dollars a year. Just to keep that status. For someone like Twitter to remain back as they were a public company was probably tens of millions of dollars a year to remain compliant. Being public at that level, it's constant audits, it's constant SEC involvement. There's a million reasons why it sucks to be public. The good part about being public is you get access to capital from the markets. You can say, hey, I'm going to do an offering. We're going to sell a million shares at $25 pop, and there, boom, you just pulled in $25 million. You didn't really have to do anything, you just did a share offering. You can't really do that with a private company. You have to go and talk to the investors and your existing company and hope that they want to put in money public. You can just put it out there and have John Q. Dipshit buy the shares. Okay. But yeah, a tremendous amount of regulation and \n",
      "probably some lim limitations on what you can and can't do as well. Right? Like when you can't. Like, as a private company, you can shit post on Twitter, say whatever you want to say. It's a public company, you obviously can't. There's like, I think you can theoretically do the same. There's probably, it's going toa be a bit more stringent if you're publicly traded versus privately traded. Right. Like, if it was a private company and I had, like, ten investors and I were to just go on Twitter and start takinganking the value of my private company or some bullshit, like, I'm sure that those people would probably want to sue me, right? Yeah. You. Well, as a private company, you still have a fiduciary duty as the CEO to, to your. Well, I mean, it depends, but, yeah, usually to your investors, you have. If you have investors, you might not. You might just own it yourself, then you can do whatever the fuck you want. That might be the case of Musk. He might not have investors. He might just, I think he just o owes money on the loans. But they not, they may not be investors. They be just debt holders, which has zero rights, if that makes sense to you. So he's responsible to no one. He can go tomorrow and say, I hate Twitter, and I'm going to burn it to the ground and have no one hold him accountable. Well, sure, but I mean, even as a private company, like you said, you can still issue equity or stock, right? Yep. But those people in that case may not have. I mean, I guess you could say they maybe have a case, but it's hard to say. Maybe I'm dumb, but don't you only get to raise capital the first time? And after that, money goes between private shareholders, it's probably done by votes of the board. But if a company's public, you have the opportunity or the ability to issue more stock. But I think doing so always dilutes your lowest Taranche of shares or whatever, or your lowest classification of shares. But a company has the ability to issue more stock if they want. Well, everyone gets diluted, usually. Well, yeah, but I think there are some. There could be, like, protected tranches or whatever, can't there? Or. No, I don't know if it's like. No. When you issue new equity in a company, everyone gets diluteed equally. What you're thinking about is kind like Mark Zuckerberg shit. Who had a different class of shares that gave him more voting rights, but it did not change his ownership in the company. So when a new employee comes on and they're like, hey, we're going to give you a bunch of shares as a signing bonus, and then you get this much a year that dilutes everyone equally because you've created more shares in a company. So if you had a million shares in the company and now there's a million. Wait, you reallyn'you, couldn't break a company into like two classes of shares, one that gives you 20% ownership, one that gives you 80% ownership, and then just dilute only the 80% ownership classes? I don't believe so. Okay. I have no idea. I know you can do it for voting rights, but I don't think that you can do that. Where one person has a. You can certainly do agreements where a person has a document saying that they have a consistent right to continue staying at their level of equity, like with future purchases. Like, for instance. \n",
      "I forget what that's called. It's a legal thing. Back in the day, it used to be common with fucking over entrepreneurs. But if I invested money in your company, I could have rights in there to maintain my equity stake at that same amount. By any future raise you do, I would have the right to be able to go and invest again at whatever the current terms is. Meaning I can always stay at 20%, if that makes sense. Sure. \n",

It was insane, wasn't it? Don't. Was the difference that much? I know. As soon as Musk made the offer, the price went near to his amount. Yeah, there was a little bit of a delta because people thought. Because people didn't know if they would go through or not. Yeah, right. It was like 30 a share and they cash out at 54.20.

Well, you might remember last year we talked about Chris in a highly controversial video posted by Sunnny V two. And the main topic being discussed in this video was Chris becoming, well, Chris with a k and transitioning from a man to a woman. Needless to wa, did he change her name to from Chris to Chris?

Even till this day. It's like constantly a huge topic of discussion online because not only is it such a hot topic in general, but he's also involved with the biggest youtuber in the world. And now Chris is once again being discussed, and it seems like their past is coming back to haunt them in the form of some strange tweets. Above that. There's also some more recent allegations that point towards Chris having a doctive, disrespect type of relationship with a fan. First, let's talk about this video that recently came out and now went viral that shows back in the 2017 to 2018 range. This video immediately connects Chris with a person named Shadman, who is known for his explicit drawings online. And he apparently got famous for depicting all kinds of disgusting things in these drawings, including underra individuals in these illustrations doing vile things. Like, anyone who thinks this stuff is okay needs to be thrown under the jail with the likes of EDP. Basically. Weirdos use this art angle as a bypass to enjoy though. Chadman draws a loly con.

      "But I think even from 2016 onwards, I think the Gamergate stuff, people would do it. \n",
      "The legality of it does more of a Chad vee cuck thing. Yeah. Still seem kind of vague to me. Well, basically, back in the day, Chris posted a ton about shad man and even had his artwork up at his house in the background of an old MrBeast video. He also posted several tweets about enjoying this type of artwork in general and other suggestive post about various cartoon characters. Type of artwork of an old Misterbeast video. He also. \n",

Okay, so there's jerking it into some lolly. All right, bring this type of artwork in general and other suggested post about various cartoon characters. And even though most of these posts are, like, seven years old at this point, at the time, he was still a 21 year old man. And this isn't just, like, some racist stuff or something that there could be, like, more gray area on, or you could say, oh, that was just like, part of the times back then. This is some weird shit that he was interested in to a massive extent. Like a grown man hanging a picture on their wall of this nasty stuff takes quite a bit of premeditated thought.

      "out of inappropriate banter publicly on Twitter when lava was only 14. Guys, we are so close to our goal. Oh, my God. One more patreon and I'm releasing my nudes. And this is the part I have a problem with. This isn't a group chat. This is literally just him and this other guy that he's been talking to and that he's friends with online. Lava says, I'm your first patreon, big boy. And, uh, he shows that he donated some money. He donated like a dollar or something. So it's not enough to meet the goal. And he says, but not $5. Pathetic. Just kidding. Kissy face. I'll tell you what it means. It means that you're telling him that he needs to donate five dollar so you can release your or whatever. He says, wait till my twitch revenue comes in, winky face. And of course it continues. He says, check again. And he tags you. I think at least that must be you, or he's tagging you. And of course he says, I posted some fire newses for you. Please no share. And this is someone that you're talking to that is 14 years old, that you know is 14. And at the end of the day, you cannot be talking about topics like this with someone that is this young. So at the very least, these two had a close enough relationship where Chris felt comfortable making these adult jokes towards him. And at the very worst, he's literally flirting with the 14 year old on the timeline. But by the time Lava would turn 16, he and he even talked about this extensively on like a MrBeast discord server. Now, I do want to make it clear that this guy prism, who made this video, spoke privately with this lava guy. And PRM claims that Lava's statement is that nothing bad ever happens when they met up back in the day, and that basically their relationship never really got inappropriate. And as I'm editing this video, guys, Lava actually took to Twitter to make his own statement about the situation where he says these videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of. Can you do me a favor and comments on these videos and tell them to stop spreading lies? The situation takes away from children who are actively being exploited every day online. I'm not a victim of anything being claimed in these videos or at all. And keep in mind that's after this morning he removed all affiliation with Mristerbeast from his Twitter page. And now we have yet another update where Keemstar has jumped into the picture. He says that Misterbeast connected him with this guy Lava directly, and that lava is denying all these allegations and now claiming that him and Chrri did not have any sort of private interactions. And then when he went to meet up with Chris that apparently his entire family and the mristerbeast crew were present. I ran discord with Chris Tyson when I was 13, as inappropriate jokes were. So take with that which you will, and you guys already know if there was gonna be one. If the IGA doesn't care, why does anyoneus? It's because the cris person is trans. So it's like the biggest lightning rod for every fucking possible thing that could ever be, you know? Yeah. Person to defend Chris in this entire situation. It was going to be that fool Ethan is online who last time we caught up with him, was pretty much defending the sick people that they catch on. Predator poachers. So here he was trying to watch the video on stream where Chris got exposed for, like, in that very strange artwork. I hate how this is formatted like a commentary video, and it feels like it \n",
      "also sounds written by AI. So the synopsis is, Ava used to, like, stop skippiving. No, because the synopsis of the videos, Ava used to, like, Shadman in 2017. Don't watch that f in dogshit video. So bad. Such an awful and terribly formatted video. Literally the worst f YouTube video I've seen a long time. So, from the start, you can tell that this guy Ethan feels some sort of personal connection to the call out in that video. Just, like, the sheer amount of anger you can see pulsing through his very tired face, to me, kind of tells the whole story of what his opinion is about to be. Yes. That video that he was watching, it wasn't, like, the best made video I've ever seen, but it's something that I would expect from kind of like a novice \n",
      "expose. Well, let's hear what Ethan thinks. Literally, just to be, like, Misterbeast's friend seven years ago had some u inappropriate tweets that were a really bad look. You're avoiding the video. That's the whole point. What am I avoiding? The truth. That it doesn't matter that it happened seven years ago. This guy was into some absolutely diabolical shit. Didn't like most of the Internet at the time. Shad man. Yes. For some reason, yes. So his excuse for this disgusting behavior is that apparently, most of the intern Internet, they were f with this nasty loser who was making these disgusting drawings. I mean, first of all, that just has to be a blatant lie. And to me, the shit he was into is just, like, inexcusable. I don't give a f when it happens. He was already an adult man. I don't need to see the whole thing. It's bad. It's a bad video. And I think that he's claimingant it's a bad video because politically, it doesn't align perfectly with him. I'm sorry. It was seven years ago. You know how many times this guy ethan has likely judged people for things that they did more than a decade ago just because they do not lineie with him politically? Like, that seems to be his wholetick is that if you're a conservative, because he's very obviously a big time liberal. Well, it's just you. He's never gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. He's gonna take your words and misconstrue them. But, oh, when it's someone who's on his side of history, well, he's gonna ride with them to the very end. I don't want to see it. It's irrelevant. That doesn't make it okay. It's not relevant, though. Is that a gross thing to do? Is it unacceptable? Yeah, but, like, the anti cancel culture warriors, all of a sudden, they're like, wait, liking tweets from seven years ago? Why are we even talking about Mister Beast friend? Because she's Misterbeast'friend. Yeah. And Mister Beast has the biggest platform, literally, in the entire world since this time, uh, Chris transitioned and is now Ava. And that's fine, but it doesn't just absolve you of all the nasty shit you were doing before you transitioned. To give you an idea of how f long ago this was, stop being defensive. You follow Chris on Twitter? Dude, this was a completely different. This is the guy who helped fabricate super mega false allegations. Who? The guy in the hoodie here or the guy with the bleached haar here? I don't remember time I was in high school when this happened. I had no idea who mristerbeast was, and neither did Mister beast. He wasn't even around. What are you saying? I think that the point they're trying to make is that every single time this type of topic comes up, whether it's someone actually, like, trying to talk to someone who's underage or just having this type of peculr your behavior, you always seem to be on the side where you. \n",
      "Are you trying to cancel Mister beast, too? Because he had that in his living room. It was in mister beast s living room. Should he be canceled, too? You can't ever defend Mister beast ever again. Don't ever defend him or watch him. Uh, yeah, mister beast doesn't have a bunch of old tweets linking him to this freak and suggesting that he was a massive fan of him. I guarantee you that if Jimmy was doing that shit back in the day, it would have been brought to light long ago, and his feet would have been held to the same fire. It shows Aias. Towards what? Towards creeps. Do you want to keep acting like Mister Beast should be canceled forever or something? No one one time said Mister Beast should be canceleed. You're the only one bringing him up at this point. I mean, everyone really just wants Chris to come out and explain why he was in. What's your take? I don't know. I don't give a fuck. He jerked it into Loigon. I don't. I super don't care. I just like one of the things. I don't care at all. He talked to minors. Did he say anything inappropriate? It probably shouldn't be. It's a bad idea for a variety of reasons. And you expose yourself to potential liability just because people make videos like this. But, like, is there anything bad that actually happened in any of this? Or because it seems all like the most boring, stupid shit in the world to that weird shit. You should be not be apologetic. Probably more upset about that than he is about the corol matter here. That Chris was on some weird shit. I mean, this guy's brain is so dense, it just honestly starts to make me a little bit upset. Like, how can someone be so confident in this way of thinking and just be so wrong? You're spelling it the way she changed it too, but you're misgendering her. So I think that shows that you have a pretty severe bias, actually. You actually have a bias that leads you outside of reality and away from logic and truth. Dude, it has to be one of the most ironic statements I've ever heard in my entire life. Where are you being defensive? Well, you're just changing the complete conversation because you don'have. Anything to say. Yeah, it's gotta be the most ironic video of all time. Um, listen, Ethan, get some help, bro. As for Chris, we're gonna need some answers. Like, in my opinion, Mister Beast don't really need to say shit about this. But Chris, like, if you want to continue to have a platform online, you need to explain yourself a little bit. Like him just wiping his entire twitter clean. It just does not look very good to me. But y'all let me know what you guys think down below. I will continue to keep y'all updated on this situation. As always, I do want to thank you guys for watching today's video, dropping a like and subscribing. But as you guys know, it's biningy boy, the tan Superman, and some other Internet news out. \n",
      "I follow mostly only influential creators here, yet most have been silent about the Chris Tyson situation. Pretty deviant behavior across the board. Weirdo. Can't wait to read some of the cope justification why it wasn't addressed. \n",
      "What is. Wait, okay. Is there other shit that got leaked? \n",
      "No. Shared. And this is someone that you're talking to that is 14 years old, that you know is 14. And at the end of the day, you cannot be talking about topics like this with someone that is this young. Even if it's this joking context, I'm not really sure what the joke is here. Um, but why do people do this? People did this with me, with the Courtney joke too. If you don't like a joke or if you don't think that the thing is appropriate to joke about, then don't. White people like, I don't even know your. It's pretty obvious what the joke is, right? What do you mean you don't know who the joke is now? You can say, I don't find it funny. I don't think it's appropriate. That's fine. But be like, I I don't even do, it's humorous about like, what the fuck? What are you'some? 47 year old, you know, like Christian pastrick the fuck out of here. This is, keep in mind you're bisexual, okay, you're talking to what? \n",
      "What? Okay, I'm sorry. Church is in session. The fuck? Damn. Came out of left field. A guy that is 14 and you'in college and the prem a guy? Don't you mean a boy is? You guys are joking with each other about sending nudes? That's illegal. You can't do that. You can't do, you can't joke about it. It's illegal to tell jokes. I'm sorry, I thought this is America. What? I know he means it's illegal to send news each other, obviously. But what is? Yeah, no shit. People joke about doing illegal thing, you know, drugs are illegal too. \n",
      "And let me just say like this. It doesn't matter if you're joking or not. Solicitation. Solicitation. There should be zero discussion about anybody sending aone to 14 years old nudes of any kind. Okay? I don't know. I'm not quite sure if you sent this guy news or not. For all I know this very well, cookie joke. But you are talking inappropriatelyly to a guy who is 14 years old and to a guy who you know is 14 years old. And that's what I have a problem with. What I have a problem with here is the way that you're talking to him. The fact that he's asking you about animated ponography. And this is re one of your friends with online, which, by the way, you should't be friends of the middle schooler to begin with because you're in college. You should be going to a bar and try to meet people or talk to people at your own age, not to middle schoolers. Like, what the hell is wrong with you? That's weird. And right here, look at this. He says, lol. I just saw. Hold up. I got get dad. So again, this guy who's 14 is calling him big boy. He's calling, Chris is calling him dad. They're sending kissy faces. They're sending winy faces and the premises. They're sending, he's sending newsud basically. And he's telling him to donate more so he can send him nudes. And he said he sent him dudes. I don't care if your're just gonna say that this is a joke. This dudes 14 years old and your're in college. You shouldn'even be talking to this guy in first place. It's sick. I need it. It's disgusting. It's not okay. It's not okay. I know, I know. Jimmy might come out to defend this kind of behavior. Like maybe you guys joke about sending nudes to 14 year olds. Is this, is this guy a grer or is this just like an aesthetic now? It's not okay. It's not okay. Why did he move this? I know, I know. Jimmy might come out toend this kind of behavior. Like maybe you guys joke about sending news 14 year. What was, why did he move that? What happened? What's going on in this videousting? It's not okay. It's not okay. I know, I know. Jimmy might come out to defend this kind of behavior. Like maybe you guys joke about sending nudes to 14 year olds often. I don't know if you guys do that. I don't know if you guys joke about, hit it with his hand if few. He needs move. He needs a, he needs space to emote. But that happened. And it's right here. It's still up online. And I gotta say, this is something, wait a second. Is this background real? Is he real? Is this AI really messed up stuff? You should not be talking to a 14 year old this way under any context. You shouldn't be saying it in a joking manner. You shouldn't be saying it in any kind of manner because this is someone you talk to one on one. This is, you shouldn't be talking to a middle schooler one on one. It's freaking weird. And of course, you have other stuff right here. This is a way to hydragen tai. I dont t know, like, what exactly we discussing with this guy, man? Why is he asking me about Insai so much? Why is he talking about with you again, super young? Oh, my God. L how I set up that embed shows you looking sexy. I don't really think you should be calling you sexy, but I get it. He's trying to say it makes you look good. Chris wee be my Valentine. Thank you, dad. Exclamat, point, heart. Thanks, lava. Love y. And just in case you wanted more proof of this guy talking to him on discord, here you go. February 7, 2019. Why did he print how \n",
      "so dramatic. He saying la his mom tomorrow, and boom. How will we been there? Yeah, there's no reason to talk about Lolly with 14 year olds who would understand Lolly better, but a 14 year old? What do you mean? At that time? Joke even says January 13, 2019. My friend Lava G'is live on twitch in the chat. Okay, this one here, this one's clearly an edgy need. It says, objectively, the easiest way to fornn rap is to start consent. That's. Yeah, just that one was s joke. Yeah, right here. The server that he made. Wait, objectively, there's not even a minor involved here. It's just an edgy joke. He's just upset about an edgy joke. \n",
      "I guess it kind of boiled down to, is it inappropriate to talk to a minor about fetishes? I mean, like, the very finely, like, thread of the needle answer there is go goingna depend on how the conversations are being. But, like, there's going toa be a ton of external indicators for whether or not this is, like, in really bad territory or not. So, for instance, if he's making a lot of these jokes privately, that's a lot more weird because it's like, okay, wait, are you trying to, like, angle this into an actual sexual conversation? But if it's all just, like, public tweets and shit, I mean, you can argue it's inappropriate if the person is younger, but fuck, I don't care much. The easiest wayvent ra. That's. Yeah, that one's a joke you have right here. The server that he made, there's Chris in the server. And it turns out that Jimmy's the same server as this guy. I don't know when Jimmy started talking to this guy. I know that he was mainly Chris Tyson'friend. He wasn't really Jimmy's friend, but still, he was also dning him at one point. But I don't think Jimmy was really this guy's friend. So here we're gonna get to the part where he was meeting up with him in person. We're gonna talk about that. So again, I have no idea. Why is he moving this all over the table? What is happening with this? \n",
      "Was meeting up with him in person. We're gonna. I have no idea. Is it like a meme for his videos? Is this like a thing he wants to this guy? Anything happened to this guy physically, I can only show that they're talking about inappropriate topics with each other. I can show that there is a vast age difference that he should not have been socializing with this guy in the first place. But he did. And the fact that he was able, like, the moment he was able to meet up with him, he met up with him in person, which I think is highly inappropriate since he was talking this guy since he was 13. And he's also attracted to men. And the guy's a guy because he's bought just as a quick thing, just as a heads up, I guess. Like, straight people can rape people of the same sex, especially children, especially if they're in positions to power them over long period of time as well. Okay, don't be like, mind fucked by that. Like, oh, it's a straight guys he could never rape, you know, this little boy or this is a straight woman, so she could never rape this little girl. Don't, don't let, don't let your mind, like, fool yourself in a think that's the caserop the circumstances you showed up in is inappropriate. Here we go. So this one's in Carl'server right here. It's a discord messaging. Discord messaging. He said, I love Carl Doe. I drove from West Virginia to North Carolina. I'm sitting in a camper in the woods right now. I love Carl Doe. So Carl. Carl is amazing. And that is a fact. True. He hugged me before Chris managed to Carl's sleep. I'm just friends with Carl. I don't need mod. His mod team is already top notch. Why do you want to come to North Carolina? Because winky face. Winky face Carl simps for me. Who doesn't s for Carl? I think we all sen for Carl. I know, right? Te offering to buy me ice cream if I do stuff again. Why do you want to come to North Carolina and money sneak me away from New York. You don'Carolina. That's why Carl sends for me.

And then when he gets 80, he just gets fuck with some by some dude with some cancer dick and he shoves it in his mouth. Mouth. Yeah. Okay. How's he going, you guys? So recently, everybody's been hearing about the Jeanette McCurdy leak of her photo. What the story is, she sent pictures to boyfriend, her now ex boyfriend, and he leaked them out. And she is a very popular Nickelodon star on the show icarly and be seen as the poulling of the show. It'll probably be taken off the air. Second off, you'll probably see the photos get taken down at some point tonight, maybe tomorrow, because Nickolodeon has that kind of power. But the links in the description, if you want. I'm not endorsing people to go look at somebody else's private business, but I know that, you know, people might want to see them. So there. It's there if you want it. First off, what I have to say though, is that when you look on the news, you see people. They've leaked nudes from their girlfriend at a high school. And that little. That girl kills herself. It's a tragic story. Everybody calls the guy a bully, but u ye when people like Perez Hilton do it considered entertainment. So why would you link them? You gonna have to think about where the right and wrong is. Really? Did he know that she was a minor or was she even a minor in these pictures or. And I think it's all wrong. Personally, I don't think somebody should leak photos that were sent in trust, but no, she wasn't. I guess if that's how present he wants to make his living, it's up to him. You be decide. You decide if it's moral. He sounds like he's like fucking 19 years old in this video. Who'thanks? For watching, guys. Okay, what is this? What? What? Whoa. \n",

Have you ever asked for Trump to publish his tax returns, for him to testify before Congress about anything like Hillary had to? Or have you criticized Trump for dodging Nikki Haley for debate requests in the RNC? And then the response was nothing. It was like, oh, that's so mean that you would say that.

I'm not even singling her out because she's trans, all right? Because I see women on camera do this as well, all right? Somewhere over the past ten years, it became acceptable to have the most insane foundation mismatch ever. All right? Either wear a turtleneck or match your goddamn foundation. This is, like, 20. Unacceptable. This is almost blackface, okay? I don't know when women do this too. Also, this isn't just a trans thing. Ordinary. Not ordinary who? Careful. I was Cisn Norma for a second there. Cisgender women do this as well, okay? Match your goddamn foundation. What? I'm officially no balls in you. Do it. There's no point. I don't even know all the lefties like me right now, okay? All the ones that hated me before are lik me now, so I'm just gonna stay on their good side for. I just want to enjoy that for, like, two weeks. Okay? Okay. Tweet the tweet. Tweet the tweet.

Number two, even if I did, that's the difference between a tan and foundation. This is not a tan. This is just a lot of foundation that is not matched with the otherly skin color. So fuck you. No, you're not. Because in my head, I fought with that every day. This is one year ago. And I hate the zoomer hairstyle. Fuck. Fuck me. Im getting old. God I hate this hair. I hate this.

Okay, this is it. What a waste of fucking time. We used to rape people on the Internet, okay? Back in the day. This is cringe \n",

Well, I was told to just wait until the video to address this, but im fine with addressing it right here. So the Twitter messages, they are authentic. Chris, he's like this super creepy dude.

If he said any of these things in person, he would have been arrested, removed from middle school grounds, because adults, they cannot talk to kids. Is that illegal? Arrest me. Okay. Put me in the slammer. Chief love to hear his opinion about the tweets, since he wants to say that, like, I'm in the wrong or I took it out of context. We'll put it into context then, maa, because I showed the tweets and, you know, I asked you, would you care to comment about it? Nathan is your son. That's very different. Okay, hold on. I'm only addressing these because you guys should know this. Number one, I'm pretty sure that the highest likelihood for abuse for children, I think, is family members. And then, like, babysitters and teachers, it's people who spend a lot of time around them in positions of power. Let me check this. I'll google this since I'm trying to correct you, and I don't want to be incorrect. Who is the most likely person to sexually abuse a child? \n",
      "Most often, sexual abusers know the child they abuse but are not relatives. O okay, so 60% are non relative acquainance, such as friend of the family. Okay. Babysitter. Usually it's people. I do know that it's usually people who are in positions of power over them for extended periods of time. That's why I said babysitter and teacher. About 30% of those whose sexually abse children are relatives of the child, such as fathers, uncles, or cousins, and then 30% are. That's still a huge number. The idea that just because you're related to somebody means you can't sexually abuse them is completely not true. But it doesn't make 30% of the child of rapists. They didn't comment about it. Like, I want your opinion about this, but you're not giving it. And I think the reason why is because, you know, the tweets are real and, you know, like he was. I think that's why you don't want respond to it. Okay. Because I mean, certainly I can understand what people might look at this and think that you're always trying to turn this person into a victim when they're saying they're not a victim. Right? Was it your right to tell the story when the person that was apparently involved in groo is saying something totally different? I mean, im'just telling you I found line. Okay, well, that's not even a good answer. It's a decent question if Chad knows the answer. I don't know if he does or not. Technically, when you're talking about child sexual abuse, the opinion of the victim is actually not, not at all relevant. It has actually nothing to do with whether or in fact, there's a lot of good reasons not to take the word of the victim at face value ever. We learn this for instss. When you look Atmanian, sex trafficking laws, the testimony from a victim can never be used to exonerate the accused because you are re assuming that if a person has been groomed or if a person's being victimized or sex trafficked, that their mind is fucked anyway and they're gonna say whatever. So technically it really doesn't matter what a victim says or an alleged victim says. They could have still been groomed and felt like they weren't groomed. That's kind of, sort of point of grooming, right. If you dont realize that something bad is happening, although you can. Right. But you know, again, just to be clear, I think some of the stuff you show is extremely troubling and its worthy of putting out there. But you were also, I think, making links and connections. Like for example, you talked about how there was an implication that there was some sort of newsud that were sent because he literally had message in that. So that was the right. Yes, it was on Twitter. You go defend grooming, please. Well, if it's a 30 year old person grooming a twelve year old, imagine all the horrible things that a twelve year old could be exposed to by other children. But if he just has advanced Twitter search, you type in lava gesss name, those tweets are still up on his side. You can see it right now. I mean, Chris isnt because he deleted his twitter, but you can see lava gess tweets on that are still up right now. And thats the thing is, I think it really interesting how he wants to say that I was taking it out of context or that Im in the wrong about this. But then he cant address those tweets like did he or did he not message you those things? Because we literally got screenointings. Sure. I guess the point Im making is youre saying youre showing what you found online. Yes, thats true to a degree. But then youre also editorializing what you found in your video and talking about and making connections and conclusions. Well, I nartive I didnt make a complete conclusion because I said I dont know if something physically happened to him. All I can show is that Chris Tyson messaged him abroppriately and met up with. I can show that aren yeah, we arent calling Chris, uh, a keyword right. We arent doing that. We were just showing our stuff. And if people want to make their own conclusions based on thats up to them. But im not calling Chris at all. That. Yeah, I mean, I said it earlier in the liveream, but im not like saying that you ever, like, physically diddle the kid. I never said that. What I said is that I can prove he messaged himappropriatelyly, met up him in person. It might have happened. We honestly dont know. And thats what we kind need answers for. U yeah, I mean, know one thing ill absolutely agree on is I think theres enough here that it does warrant response from, from Christmas to beast, the Chapan stuff and and then this. But, you know, its, um, yeah, its difficult because I can also see a narrative pers respective where this person wants to offer some defense or cover for them. But, like, I guess, again, some stuff that isn't nailed on the video, you know, that would make a lot stronger case. Kind of discount someone saying when it wasn't like this, it wasn't like this, you know, soe make video with a stronger, like aspect to. Is that right? Yeah. I'm gonna make a comprehensive video that will, you know, blend all the information'can be more watchable because I'm gonna honest there. Cicadas, there's birds. I could have done better, but I was under a time crunch because I can't talk about all the details about that. Why are you under a time crunch? Is this guy about to go become like a fucking preschool teacher, you know, in like two weeks or what is the time crunch? Because they. It's not about preciseon but there's like a police investigation and I can't say anything about that. Um, and so what I did want to say was, uh, hold on yeah. Um. Or sorry. I'll let for you speak real quick. Yeah right. I guess everybody I'm looking at theat right now. I see. Let's sm. \n",
      "Nobody's making any sexual jokes online to you right? Yeah they better. \n",
      "I'mnna go through your whole discord later. If there's any inappropriate jokes there, I'm calling the cops. And you're going to juvie \n",
      "bets on a police investigation was opened. Probably 0% chance. Why would that? And how would that impact any of who went yeah right gu everybody I'm looking at the chat right now. I see everybod saying let'san \n",
      "Sm in just a moment because smgle is connected to some of the youtubeers. Like I think he's worked somewhat with Tury to before. So he may have some information I believe maybe get just saying on 100 percent'do that in just, in just a moment. U but yeah I mean I guess. I guess that like lets go. Let okay. Sor sor. I remember what was so go on. So lava G's hes still in contact with Chris. Obviously he told Chris about this and you know his response to this. I dont know if hes actually saying this where Chris is actually saying im aware that he told us when we were asking him about this sort of stuff. He completely said that theres nothing weird about Chris. But then we know thats not true because the shad man stuff. But he was like saying that, you know, nothing happened in that, you know, Chris is completely innocent. We're playing very fast and loose with words. There's nothing weird about Chris. But we know that about the shad. When they say there's nothing weird about Chris problem. He wasn't like grooming or trying to like do weird shit in DM's. Although we were very. So he did think that we were having him edit for us and that, you know, that's why he was telling us all this. Like he tr \n",
      "fine fin let me hold on. That's not true because the Shadman stuff but he was like saying that, you know, nothing happened in that, you know, Chris is completely innocent. Although we were very. So he did think that we were having him edit for us and that, you know, that's why he was telling us all this. Like he wa. So you tricked him into a betd them y. So he was fine. He was fine with us. Okay. He didn't know why we were interviewing him basically. O I understand now \n",
      "fan oh, interesting. Okay. \n",
      "Like the reason he was, you knew he said we didn't have to worry about recording around him. But he didn't know that that was the reason. And it's because we literally see this guy that is into this pedophile art. He messaged a minor inappropriately. And so I could literally see like, we tried to reach out to this guy three times before and then we actually get aold of him. And the thing is, we need to know if something happened to this guy or not. But we knew he's supporting Chris Tyson still. So we had to try. We had to ask them like, oh, hey, you know, we're making content about these creeps or whatever. O we were not molested. We didn't have any groomeors or anything. But we said, oh, we were, we had, you know, people that talked inappropriiately to us. They were trying to send us pictures. Did this thing ever happen to you? And he said, no, this, you know, it didn't happen to me. And then he specifically said, oh, Chris Tyson's nothing wed about that guy. That's not, no, that's not completely true. He said something like that it might have happened, but he didn't really realize it. Oh, okay, sorry, I misspoke then. Well, here I think I should let Beie speak because I'm just gonna ramble. No's fine. I just like smaggle. Wait, wait, wait. I let you go a second. I want to say one thing right, and I feel like there is a case to be made here and I think there is information that's worth having out there. And I appreciate you're small and you wanted to hand it off to people, but there has been, you know, numerous areas of arguing competence and going about this and baiting someone into a conversation. And then now you're getting them coming out saying, this video is totally wrong. You to understand this very much undermines the case you're trying to make. What? Have you ever heard of James O'Keefe from Project Veritas, right? I mean, yeah, James O'Keefe is not like the person you should necessarily look as an avatar of success. ##ations are riddled with issues like the fucking post office thing where that guy from the post office got led down with hearsay to act like he'd be able to prove that there was some problem with the fucking votes. And then it didn't transpire, become anything because the guy, you know, was presented as this, this paragon or someone that could reveal information that didn't happen. You know what I'm talking about, right? The guy who wears the post office, he got, you know, sun. I mean, there's a lot of things he does. So I don't know o youring. Okay. I don't want to get youiqu with. I gu'take a. He does amazing work, but this is the problem. How do you do this? Arg getting super political. I feel like what you've done is you've got someone that you look up to in James, and James O'Keef isn't perfect, but, you know, you've done it in a very shitty way. So now there's problems with what you've done. You understand the problems that you presented in doing this, right? Yes. I mean, I do see some of the problems. Yeah, on, hold on, hold on't't. Let, don't speak for him. Let prison talk. Okay. All, all right. So what was the question? Do I see the problems that it caused? Yes. I mean, what just, I want to be super clear. I'm trying to think of ethics for journalism. I don't know if I care in this circumst, there might be reasons why I should care. I don't know if it's necessarily unethical or bad to do sting type operations if you're getting information. So, like, them pretending to interview him for a job and finding out information. I don't know if that's necessarily bad. I don't even know if that was necessarily a bad thing that O'Keeffe did. The bad thing was that they didn't find solid information or they didn't follow up well on the information they did find. And everything they investigated and then made strong claims about ended up being bullshit. And they, those were the really big bad things. Not just the fact that they were like sting or secret interviews. It was the fact that they didn't find much, but they tried to pretend that they found way more than they actually did. That was the issue. I see. What I see is that I was able to confirm all the stuff because people are saying, oh, do you have absolute confirmation? Do you have absolute confirmation? If we never reached out to them, would we have absolute confirmation? I mean, yeah, there is the picture, but people supposedly the picture wasn't enough is what I've been seeing, which I think is pretty ridiculous. What picture? The picture of the meeting up. Picture of them meeting up. Okay, but do we, do we know before that that he knew about his age? Because there's a difference between him messaging someone. Okay. Are you saying it was okay? Okay, saying. I'm saying we need. \n",
      "Are you saying that if someone o so he didn't even know he was a minor. If he's fighting so much on this, that's what it sounds like. Sleeps with a minor. You're saying, oh, they can just pull the oh, I didn't know their each card and then just get off. Sc so why you getting angry at me for? Because you didn't confirm the a. You didn't know? No, no. Dudeut you want to disrespect me? Why do I have to continue talking to you? Why do I right now smuggle? Just calm down. There's no need. I understand. Upset because, you know, people were trying to say I was being transphobic because I was calling out this guy for being. I'm not what I thought you would say. Dude, I literally hopped on the stream and I saw a girl saying that, you know, there's, \n",
      "that's not what I'certainlyah, I am mad at you because you, you the first person you thought of was going to another fucking pedophile before Chr. That was not the first person. The first person was Chris Cham, the guy that fuckgot wrong. That is false. Was first person \n",
      "new. It was a news website. Was a journalist. I tried to get this out to people. I exhausted all my resources. The average person doesn't have connections. I didn't have connections, but I did know how to tell you thought the best course of action was going to e best course of action. It's what I had. You really think it's all going to be sunshine and rainbows against a channel that has 132 of the world's population subscribe to them? Do you honestly think that, you know, I also think that like, no, \n",
      "dude, I can't see anything else. I've mind fucked myself. Every, every accusation is a confession, okay? When people come into my chat and I realize it now, and I'm. When that guy came in my chat earlier and he said, oh, you're just not, you're just defending Chris or whoever. I don't even give the fuck this person. You're defending this person because they're trans. What you're actually saying is. What you're actually saying is, is I just want to make the accusation because they're trans. That's the only reason you give a fuck about this. That's why you're so obsessed about this. That's what's happening here. Yeah. And then like the self victimizationh, I'm supposed to go against the channel with 132 of the world's populate. What do you think, mister? Be's gonna call a fucking hit on you. You think Mister Beast is gonna, what, order your assassination? \n",
      "You either have a good story, you don't. Dude. Like, yeah, is there a big risk if you get it wrong? I guess maybe you're not even anybody on the Internet. Not to say that, like, oh, not to lil bro, anybody. But just like, it's not like you've got an Internet reputation or career at stake. And if you have a good story, right, you could literally create, could, you could create an entire career out of this. So, I mean, there's a huge upside for you as well. Like, I think that any normal person would look through o what has EDP done in the last few years and not go through him because he is a better fight. Listen, I appreciate the content brain. We want bloodsports. Okay? But clearly that is not the way to get the best out this conversation. Okay. Yes, I think we can all agree going to EDP is fucking retarded. Okay. However, what I would say is I at least understand the logic a little bit because EDP did call out prast, right? And team Stor talked about it too, and people were talking about it. I literally had friends that said, hey, look, he's covering it. And I could just send him all the other information and then have him talk about it, but then he wouldn't do it. I understand from the perspective of, you know, someone like yourself, who clearly is not about this life, doesn't do the YouTube thing, having that kind of mentality. I think it's retarded, to be clear. But I do at least understand. Okay, it was a stupid move. It was a stupid move. O no. So the logic behind it is stupid. All right? But if it wasn't for that, I literally wouldn't even have talking to Virius. I wouldn't have gotten involved with and those videos wouldn't have made and gotten out there if it wasn't for the fact I reached out to EDP. So, you know, the information is out now. And if I didn't reach out top, the information wouldn't happened now. And's because I wouldn't have uploaded those videos because there's another guy who we can't talk about who was essentially that put pressure on us to release these videos and he didn't directly tell us. But u why is there this pressure? Don t understand this pressure argument. Why you have any pressure? You're like, nothing. Yeah, what, in another video? You can't talk about that. What do you mean? You say why there's pressure? If you can't talk about it, then why bring it up in place? That's what happened. Bulit, listen, from my perspective, right. I wasn't there when he reached out to EDP, right. I can say it is stupid to reach out to a predator. I known predator, right. And tried to get him to cover something about, you know, somebody else. Right? Did he reach out to people before EDP? Yes. Yes. But I think stupid will learn, right've got be honest virus. You seem like the organ grinder. Okay. And you seem like the monkey to be fish of you. Let's hear more from Furtus about this for a sec. Okay, smaggle, what you have you got a question or a point you want to bring to the table to move forward? Yes. So my question is why did. My question is when on call with reporters, former President Trump says he will commit to debating VP Harris but is not thrilled with ABC as s debate host says. He says he'd be willing to do more than one debate as well. Oh, shit. Did you record this interview with the Mina with lava and why did just duringin this stream was your take that it was weird. But the person isn't a pedophile. I don't know if they're a pedophile or not. In my mind. I don't know how you can masturbate to loliccon and not have an attraction to like minors or like minor children. I don't get. I don't understand that. \n",
      "I've just never gotten that. But didn't you include the interview in the original video? Okay, so he listen, but also listen. If you want to jerk off to fucking whatever the fuck, knock yourself out. Just don't rape any kids. But, but it seems weird. That's goa be like, oh, yeah, o I fucking love lo but I'm not attracted to minor bodies at all. Okay, thanks. Right, the interview, we still had to look through multiple sections of it. Right. We had to like depict. Okay, he said this year he okay, did we ask him this correctly? There was like information that was, you know, we wanted to double check. And the video, we released it without the interview because again, I don't want to keep going in circles, but we should have, you know, put the interview in the video. That's a good point. I'm not even going to argue that. But we are going to do that. You know, I think maybe within the next, I would say maybe two weeks, we're going to release a much bigger and more comprehensive video where the interview is going to be also there no the interview should have been in the video. You're right. Ok. Okay, good. Yeah. Sorygle, please go on. Worse you also. Sorry, one more thing. The interview is really long as well, so it could be a video of its own. You know, just a little side points. But it's still. I want prism to answer this because I found a comment, some other people have found the comment that Lava put out like four weeks ago. I sent it a cht saying, this video is not true and disgusting. Avari has never done anything wrong. And for you to make up these laws and create this narrative is just wrong. Also, when you interviewed me for a supposed editing job, why did you lie? So you can take. Okay, I'm not trying to listen. Okay. My lips to move. I had a listis. Okay, I'm not trying to make fun of people with listiss or anything like that, but is this. Is bol a person with a lisp? Are there multiple commentary people with lisps? Or is this the same person as I was thinking before? Does bowbloocks have a lisp or am I thinking of somebody else? It's a gundam. \n",
      "It'partially because of his accent. So after Coney Connors made their tweet alleging that doctor disrespect sent inappropriate. Oh, no, he doesn't have it either. Never mind. I've always been upfront and real with you guys on anything I can be upfront about. And I'm always, no, this isn't even a list. And this guy doesn't have a lisp either. Take the clips out of context. This is disgusting. And then prism says, care to comment why? When you were 14, there's a. There's a name. Hold on, I should know this name for when you cannot pronounce r roticism. Is that what it's called? Apparently the r sound, I think, is the hardest sound to produce in the english language. Somebody can tell me if I'm wrong or not. I think it's the most difficult one. So this will be the one that in development, children oftentimes will have the most to with if they do have trouble, I believe. Yo. Hi. What's up? You want to talk about Chris Tyson? Yeah, I started looking at it. I was hoping for some juicy shit. It seems kind of boring and dumb to me. Should I care? Is there anything to care about here? So to me, I know you have a personal different opinion than me on this, but I find the lolly shit pretty gross. But that's the grossest thing that I've seen. Everything else as far as the interactions with minors, like, people are tweeting out saying that they're, like, grooming a kid. They're saying that they're manipulating. Chris left his family to message minors. And obviously, the implication, right? If you say the message miners, the implication behind that is like, they're messaging, like, here's my fucking transd dory. Yeah, it's really disingenuous. And then when he said. He said something about, like, linked revenge porn to minors, and I was like, jesus Christ. But he just. He made a YouTube video, and then they had the f happenening show with that one actress, but it was just in the YouTube video description. He's not, like, sending DM's to miners with links to it or whatever. Yeah. So I don't know if Jeanette McCurdy was underage when those got out. Obviously, that's pretty bad. Which I don't think she was. I mean, I can't deny that when I was 17 or 16, I didn't look at the fucking f happenening, okay? I was looking at Jennifer Lawrence. I was like, whoa, that's cool. You know? And I don't think you should spread that as a public content. Wait, you were looking at leaked revenge porn? Nudes of people? You said turkey Tom. Yeah, absolutely. You consumed a lot of revenge porn when you were a minor. You said absolutely \n",

      "Be tr. No, just kidding. U realistically, though, yeah, I mean, the lolly stuff, to me is the worst part. And I think people are kind of missing the point of the shad man stuff. And I. I wish commentary channels weren't glossing over the shad stuff, because to me, there's a lot more substance there. Shadman wasn't just a lolly artist. Okay. You know, I don't like lolly stuff, but if you want to make the argument, oh, it's not real children, you know, whatever, it's kind of a stalemate, in my opinion there, right. There's not much I can really say. But he drew caricatures of, like, real people, right? Caricatures is putting it. Lately, Shadman was, like, fawning over Daphne Keene, the actress, and Logan, and, like, dM's, he was like, she's an Irl lolly. I love her so much. And then he drew her, and then her management saw it and got his website shut down. And this is like a consistent problem for him. Right. So it's like an irl lolly Jesus. Yeah. Was. My opinion is that Shad man is a pedophile. Did he molest anyone? No. My opinion is that he is attracted two children. I think you probably have to be a pedophile to draw a real child that you see in real life. Fantasize about her and then draw her being raped. I think that's probably pedophilia. But people are not talking about that. And instead they're talking about this investigation stuff. All these DM's. Some of the DM's that I've seen, not from that one guy's video, but some of the DM's I've seen released on Twitter seemingly have already been proven to be fake. And, uh, they're DM's, I think, drama alert and some other account posted. Um, some of them, I think, uh, do appear to be real, like Snapchat messages. But to me, their're context list. The biggest thing for me is figuring out what going on in those conversations. Um, because in and of itself, like, you know, Chris Tyson at 22, making, like, edgy, sexual, gross jokes to, like, people who are 1415. That is pretty, you know, it's foul. It's foul. But the question for me is, can it be chalked up to, like, irresponsibility? Or are there. Is there, like, explicit proof that he was, like, trying to, like, meet up with these kids and do shit like that? Like, seemingly when that one person u was their name from. From that kid s video where he's sitting on the picnic table lava or whatever, that guy, he first of all said that nothing bad happened between him and Chris, so. Also doesn't matter really that much, though, because technically, if it's a grooming victim, you would expect them to defend the abuser. Not to say that Ava is an abuser, but I'm just saying. But, yeah, but I mean, like, the fact that you already don't have anything from them. Yeah. It's that combined with the lack of anything substantial. And if they had. If they had been, like, sexting and talking about nudes and then they met up, obviously that's a pedophiing thing. But from what I can tell from the DM's, they look very bad. But considering that they met up with Mister Beast and then I think he was like, they played Uno together. It's disgusting. It's like. Yeah, like, I don't know. Like, obviously there's, you know, stuff to criticize Chris for Chris does seem to be kind of, kind of a freak in some ways. But wait, are they still, are all of these DM's and all of these interactions like four plus years old? From what I've seen, they're all pre 2020. Including all the Shadman tweets are pre 2020 as well. Now, the Shadman stuff does bother me quite a bit, and I would question Chris on that for sure. Sure. But beyond that, the other stuff I've seen seems to be reaching. I gotta look into it more, but it seems to be kind of reaching for something grasping once again. I feel like the, the point, the real point you could get Chris Tyson on is getting lost. And any shad man criticisms are going toa go at the window once Chris or anyone from the Misterbeast camp responds, because they're go goingna be like, all these people are claiming that Chris groomed a kid, which didn't happen, you know? So yeah, that's my understanding so far. But maybe there will be more when I look into it where I'll be like, Chris is a fucking whoais Chris Peto? But I haven't seen that. Uh oh. Oh. Hello. Hello. Hello, Tom and hello, Stepven. Wow, you saw pers discisord. This is a legendary friend of the stream. \n",

Give me your 1 minute take. What do you want? Go ahead. My 1 minute take. Is that. Isn't it bad enough, though, that she bought art from Shadman knowing? Well, I guess she could. She could claim that she didn't know. Yeah, I think. But what thom is saying is probably true in that, like. And then this also ties into what I was saying about, like, israel Palestine people instead of like. \n",
      "So for instance, maybe. I think there's probably arguments to be had that the widespread distribution of lolicon is not the best thing. There's probably really strong arguments that the widespread distribution of locon drawn of particular people isn't a good thing. And if you believe that, there's a really good argument that you probably shouldn't financially support those people. But that conversation is completely off the table now, because now everybody's obsessed over whether or not Ava has groomed and like, raped a minor. Like, that's the issue. Yeah, nobody can even talk about that. I think that's exactly it. I agree. Anna. Like, what Chris did do is very bad, but the conversation publicly is being completely taken away from that, unfortunately. See? Yeah, you see, kind. I'm glad you see. That's kind of a shame because I. I don't know, I just. I guess I find that kind of disturbing, though, to buy art from Lolly. I mean. Okay. Isn'part. Isn't part of the issue, though, that, like, not only, like, the funding of Lolyon, it's called Lolyon, I think. Right. I'm sorry, I don't know the terms. Yeah, yeah, that would be the term, I think.

I was just gonna ask something, because we're talking about Chadman right now. I'd seen Teamstar put out a tweet saying that he had a private conversation with Chris Tyson about the fact that Shadman had drawn his daughter when she was, I believe, eight years old. Like, giving head to Donald Trump. And in ke tweet, basically says, like, he's still upset about it or something. Wait, hold on. I'm so sorry. My short circuitited halfway through that sentence. I'm sorry. Chadman drew whose daughter? Teamstar. Okay, gotcha. All right. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. And then Keemstar was still upset about that. Okay. Yeah. And I'm just. Well, I would be very curious because Keim hasn't, like, said anything that Chris didn't know about, like, this history or anything. Right. Which is, like, you'd think that you would want to include that when discussing the situation. You know what I mean? If you're that much of a shad man fan, where you're buying his art and you're, like, responding to a lot of his posts, you probably know what he's been doing. I would. That. Well, that's what I'm saying is. That's what I'm saying is Chris, like, they're going to suggest that, oh, there was no idea, and that they just commissioned this artwork and, you know, the sample size of what they made seenene from Shadman is not adequate enough to, you know, prove that she knew about lolly stuff. But then, you know, just to see this as, like, Chris not pleading ignorance themselves, or at least likely not as Teamemstar didn mentioned it. I feel like that's like a pretty big indictment on them now. Maybe. Okay. All right. I'm bored to this topic because this is fucking cringe. I thought there's gonna be some crazy shit happening.

Right now there should be nine Supreme Court justices on the court. All of the different judges will come to a decision about if they agree or if they disagree with the decision from the lower court, which is usually a circuit court. Okay? So for our federal courts, it goes first is a district court, then it's a circuit court. There's eleven circuits, I think, in the US, plus DC, I think. And then the Supreme Court, our federal Supreme Court, or the federal Supreme Court will take a case that went up through a state supreme court. Right? So the states have their own court systems and then their highest courts. From there it'll bounce to the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court here'a case, they decide whether to agree or disagree with the lower court's ruling. And when they do that, they write an opinion of the court, the majority opinion, okay, meaning the one that most of the judges agreed with. This opinion is the one that is considered the opinion that when it's talking about what was specifically before the court and the decision from the lower court, this is the controlling or this is the holding opinion that's written by whoever decides to write that opinion. So even though it's called an opinion, it's like the ruling itself will be whether or not you vacate or hold. You can do other things too, but whether or not you basically agree with the lower court or disagree with the lower court, that'll be like the ruling. And then the opinion is goingna be the legal argumentation or justification for why you ruled the way that you did.

Well, it looks like a jury of his peers thinks that he did some super fucked up shit. You're completely dead wrong there. If he did super fuck up shit, there probably would have been some serious repussions. Okay. All right. My badd. Sorry. Let me rephrase this. So it sounds like a jury of his peers has said that he did bad things. Yeah. Yep. I think you were on the side of it wasn't bad things, if I remember correctly in the past. I don't remember. It's been years, but I think I said this could go either way. I don't remember, though. Well, it's gone away now. It's pretty, pretty clear. If he had to ask, you know, every time I bring this up, God, you know, the worst people are the simps of this fucking guy. I mean, the haters are just as bad. You just thought that it was, like, a serious thing, and he actually, like, bas away from this almost completely scot free. You understand that, right? You understand that, like, the board can't suspend him or do anything else for him. You basically, they just said, you have to send a letter to everybody about't hate Trump. So you're like, oh, well, you can't hate Trump because he got away scot free. I didn't say I can't hate him because he got to wayte Sc Freek. So why'd you just say that to me then? You said, he gott awayte scot free. Doesn't matter. So I'm sorry. Why? I didn't say he got away Scott free. It doesn't matter. I said that his haters. It doesn t matter. I said that his haters can be pretty unhinged, too, as evidenced by the fact that you thought he just had a severe repercussion, when in reality he basically got, like, the lightest slap on the wrist. Possible, it seems. No, I agree. He got reprimanded. But to be clear here, all the people are like, he's doing nothing wrong. You're being. \n",

Another reckful comes back from the fucking dead and he does the same thing, he may lose his license. That's how wrong what he did was. You didn't specify any'ing why. I have passion about this. It's for two reasons. One, it's because of the army of simps this guy has that lose their fucking mind whenever you say that maybe he shouldn't be doing what he's doing. That's the first thing. And then the second thing is that you have. People are like, yeah, you know, you're just mad for no reason. No, I'm mad because I think. And now a jury of his peers has agreed and said, yeah, he's doing something bad. So, yes, just to be clear, real quick, what you just said, those two statements didn't agree with what you just said. You said, it's clear that he's hurting people. The board felt like that he undermined the medical profession with regards to this one person. Oh, so is that helping people when you undermine. No, you said hurting people as though it made a statement about the multiple people or whatever. This had to do with one thing, and I. \n",

Correct. Okay, he hurt one person in. Are you saying that's a neutral act? Is it a neutral act? I've never made a statement. Why would it be a neutral act to hurt somebody? Is it helping people? Is what helping people? Engaging in conduct. Sorry. Engaging in conduct that undermines the public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. Is that helping people? I would say that's hurting his profession. Okay. I would say that that hurts people. Doing that, undermining this stuff. Sure you can, but when you commit any crime, it, theoretically it hurts the entire public. That's what criminal law is for. That's why they're crimes. But the issue here was related directly to reckful. \n",

If you think but saying you don't know, it's fine. I don't know either. I think there's probably an additional investigation. My guess would be no, only because if they had multiple things going on, I don't know if they would just release like this one thing and then do another thing later on. I don't know why you wouldn't like bundle the complaints. Well, I mean, as more as an additional, like for instance, let's say six months ago I had a real issue with Doctor K and then I made a complaint to the board. Do you think that you can just continually stall investigations forever by piling on more and more and more? I think that they usually keep them probably separate per incident. I would imagine that if you've got like seven or eight. No, they wouldn't just keep delaying it, but they'd have enough to build a consensus and then they would say, yeah, these are all these things and it's not good. \n",
      "Well, I don't know. Yeah, no, I feel good about it. Now, at the very least, maybe he's not punished. Maybe he can keep doing what he's doing, but at the very least, his peers that have said what you did was not okay. Now you can argue a little bit about how okay it was, but a jury of his peers have said no go. What exactly is no go? Well, hold on, be clear. Before I say anything, I need you to answer the discord dm I sent you earlier, because that determines a lot about what happens moving forward. Just don't be fucking retarded. That's your guidance. I I don't. Okay, Dan, I kind of actually agree with you, interestingly enough. Yeah. Because Anna is a hater. A doctor k hater. I don't hate him. No, no, no. I guess I have a bit of a more nuanced opinion about this, but, yeah, I'm surprised that I actually do agree with Dan. Dan, are younna. You actually submitted a complaint to the ethics board, Dan? No, no, no, no. What? Oh, I'm sorry. Me, miss, you have me mistaken with another jew. \n",
      "What? You have me mistaken with another jew that doesn't like doctor K. He's referring to Max. Mister girl. Mister girl. Gotcha. Okay. But we'd also. We don't even know if Mister girl'the, one who filed the complaint. We don't know if this complaint was his complain. Absolutely. We don't know if this is the complaint that he filed, though we have any way of knowing that it might be, but I don't know if we can ever know that. I imagine those are probably kept anonymous. Maybe. I'm not sure h. \n",
      "I feel vindicated. You know, the punishment's not what I would have liked. I would have liked him to have to stop doing what he's doing pretty much altogether. I think it's bad. I think that form of therapy publicly, especially with impressionable \n",
      "broadcast, your most personal, intimate shit to thousands of people that's on the Internet forever, is bad. And yeah, I'm a hater. And it's good to see that a jury of his peers agree that all the stuff that a lot of these people were sweeping for. Doctor K, saying that you're wrong, he's helping people. How is this different than just talking to. This is a real quick. Every single thing that Dan is saying is incorrect. I don't know why hes. Yeah, yeah. Okay, just to be clear as. Go ahead, explain to me, because I'm capable. The reprid. The reprimand was given explicitly and specifically for rec case. Yes, yes. So you keep, but you keep saying, people are saying he helpsy bl blah, bl blah. All of that. None talking pretty explicly about reckful. No, it wasn't. We can go. We can. We can go back and listen, if you want you me to rewind the stream and we go back and listen to exactly what you just said. I do. Okay. All right, let's do it. Hold on, I'm muting. Why this that all the stuff that a lot of these people. Yeah, I'm a hater. And it's good to see that a jury of his peers agree that all the stuff that a lot of these people were sweeping for. Doctor K saying that you're wrong, he's helping people. How is this different than just talking? This is a real quick. Every single thing that Dan is saying is incorrect. Okay. Yeah. When you say that everybody was saying that Doctor K is helping people and blah, blah, blah, you're implying that it's about the totality of what he does or multiple conversations \n",
      "during the wrkful shit at that time. That's when everyone was going off. So you're going to say that I was. Well, you can insinuate if you want. That's fine. I can be more specific with my complaints moving forward. \n",
      "Okay, that's good. Yeah. So, yeah, it's good. How do you. Do you agree that his conduct with recful was inappropriate to the level where he should have been reprimanded? I don't know. Like I said, pretty sure I said a long time ago is. Well, they don't really put a big argument. I don't see the deliberation in the consent order. But like I said before, I think that it's a pretty hairy issue. I think it's pretty difficult. I probably make argum hair way, and I think that's evidenced by the fact that the only thing that happened was a reprimand, which is it looks like probably the lightest type of punishment that you could ever get for a thing where a person literally fucking killed themselves. So I imagine if there was like any type of actual serious, like, crazy wrongdoing here, he probably would have ve been hel. No. A much hard get for someone killing themselves is nothing. If you did nothing wrong. I think plenty of people will. That nothing wouldn't be a punishment. I think the lightest of a punishment you can get would probably be this. That'd be my guess. Okay. Do you think that how much punishment someone gets is indicative of the crime committed? It's indicative you to. I'm sorry, let me know when you. Yeah, go ahead. No, no. Okay. You keep harping on the fact that he's only reprimanded and not losing his license permanently. So I just want to kind of a clear answer out of you. Do you think that the punishment that these guys handed down is important in the context of determining if what he did was wrong or not? \n",
      "Generally, the severity of the punishment will match what a given body thinks the severity of the crime is. So in the case where there is a very, very, very low punishment, then it seems to be the opinion \n",
      "a very, very low crime. Okay. Are you familiar with outliers and things along those lines. I've heard of that term before. Yeah, out loud you'hear of that? I am familiar, yeah. Okay, so if someone does something in to get a light punishment, do you think that that probably wasn't that bad then? \n",
      "If somebody did something and got a light punishment, does it mean that the thing wasn't very bad? Yeah. Well, it seems like right now you're kind of dismissive about this and likeh, well, I guess, you know, it's a complicated issue, but it sounds like, you know, I mean, what did I say that was dismissive? This whole conversation is dismissive. It's not dismissive. You're just an unhinged hater. I'm just stating like very, very, very basic. Like no reasonable mind can disagree with any of the really basic assertions on. I've said that generally punishments will match the severity of the crime that a particular judge or court thinks of the crime. Typically that's a true thing. So the fact that his license was reprimanded, which is probably one of the lowest forms of punishment you could give, means that the board here must have figured that whatever error he committed here wasn't that grave in the totality of all the errors that he could commit. Can I ask you a question? If you you'been arrested before? Yep. You have? Yep. I have two. Well, let's imagine you haven't been arrested before. If you got arrested for breaking into someone's house, what do you think would happen to you as a first time offender? I would get arrested. And what do you mean? What do you think your punishment would be as a first time offender? It depends on a ton of mitigating, aggravating circumstances. It depends on so much, you know, what you're doing right now is a very conservative strategy. Can you engage in. I'm not. Instead, \n",
      "let me get. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Can I just do this instead of like, wasting our. No, it's not called out. You're the one that's doing some weird rhetorical debate trick. Just say this. First time offenders tend to not be sentenced as harshly ase repeat offenders. We don't need to do a whole hypothetical train for this. I don't know why you wouldn't just say that. Why do we have to ask 20 questions to get to that point? A repeat offender. Because I'm trying to make you look stupid. Because I feel like you're sweeping for Doctor K when it seems pretty clear that what they've said here is that he did something fucked up, but it's a first time, so, hey, you're re only reprimanding you. Okay, I'm sorry. Hold on. Do you think that people can't have their licenses suspended or they can't warrant more severe punishments for a first time offense? I think that this is a new area of things that probably. The board of Massachusetts has probably never dealt with a case like this ever before. If this was a case about a psychiatrist having a sexual relationship with their client, I think that there would be an entire fucking step by step book that they could follow and they could give a punishment based off of that. You don't think they have any guidance on people who are therapists giving therapy to. Okay, all right. No, I think there's probably no guidance on how do we handle a situation where there's a psychiatrist that's doing online streaming on twitch of people's shit. I don't know. Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's almost no guidance on that whatsoever. This is literally the first time that this has happened. You know, what a strategy you have, and I like it, is that you play the piano when I'm talking so as to minimize my position, but really what it is is that you can't think of a defense, so you're buying yourself time to try and think of something to come up against me. And I like that. I don't have to's literally. No, no, keep playing. Keep playing. Give yourself more time. I don't want toa rush. You think? Go back, think of something good, Dan. You feel when he playsiano, while you're trying to argue, what does that make you feel? I don't hear the piano. I see him playing the piano. I don't hear. I wish I could hear the song, but I'm sure it's a good one. And I'm sure right now he's thinking of a really good retort and he's like, okay, fuck. I don't want to get on Doctor K's bad side, because I've been on a show a few times and it's really gonna fuck my shit up if I call him out. But, man, this thing is pretty fucking cut and clear. That, man. Doctor K did some fucked up shit. And I remember in the past I was saying this wasn't a big deal. And they're saying here that this is completely inappropriate. The whole thing, man. I don't know. I don't know. Hold on. What can I do? Wait, I got it. And this is where you stop playing and you say, something. Do you need more time? Okay, I don't think I've said, what if I said that is controversial or incorrect? No, I'm saying your past takes on this have been what I would categorize as sweeping for Doctor K. That was my past takes on this. We'sweeping. I feel they were sweep adjacent. How about that? Okay, hold on. Let's see what I somebody likeink this. I don't even remember what I said. Good for twitch, but holy damn, does he have, like, some very huge conflict of interest going on in his business that are, I'll say questionable at best and maybe, I don't know. I say malicious at worst, but, like, bordering on really, really, really bad stuff. There's a lot of very bad conflict. I think that everything that he does is, is okay in terms of the promotion of his business and everything, but when he starts personally counseling the most popular people on Twitch who also happen to support his coaching, and there's a lot of weird conflicts there that start to pop up that probably aren't good. But I don't know, maybe, maybe I wouldn't feel that strongly once I see them in context or I, not thex. I mean, in connect me video. Yeah. Do you feel like that the. Okay, so just to be clear, I don't even remember what I said two years ago. My takes, two years ago. We're way more clear and way more accurate. They're more accurate. They're more accurate of what actually happened than what your prediction was. Because your prediction was it was going to be totally unhanded. She was gonna lose everything. My prediction was, I don't know, it feels like it's bordering on some severe conflicts of interest with some of the conversation talks and you got reprimanded for it. What'gonna happen to him? I don't think I ever predicted that. I said that. It was fucked up. You managed to have one of your psychopantic dick sucks find the one time that you dared step out of the fucking line and remotely criticize this fuck. But if you go through and you find the other times that we talk about doctor K, you'll see that you're in there like, yeah, I think it's fine. So, yeah, I don't know what to say. You have the one time and all the people that are like, in here excited about this. You're excited that what? That destiny is saying that Doctor K was bad. This is a man, this is a tough spot to be in if you're a doctor K. Destiny. Sim. Are you excited that in the past. Destiny said that Doctor K was full of shit and was probably doing some fucked up shit. Or are you more excited that you found that moment that he said that he was full of shit? This is God. What do you do? I don't know. It's rough. Okay. Have you had enough time on the piano to compose your thoughts? What? I actually, I can't play the piano, but usually when I try to get my thoughts when I'm on a call, sometimes I'll pace around the room when I have my phone on speakerphone. And that helps me a little bit. \n",
      "I think that helps me to think, just having my phone out. We there anything else we need or. I don't know. Did you not come up with anything during that whole, I don't know, re not even. There's nothing even for me to respond to. I don't know what I'm supposed to respond to right now. You're supposed to say, oh, give me a second and I'll give you a statement to say. \n",
      "What would I like you to say? A jury of doctor K's peers have found that he acted inappropriately enough with reckful to the point where they reprimanded his license. Yeah, that's true. Yes. What you just said is true. Yeah. And not only did they do that, I agree with that now that I had a chance to think, and my prior statements where I've made that I did not agree with that were incorrect and not bayed. \n",
      "Okay. Do you agree with that? Yeah, that's been my statement the entire time. Yeah. You fucking. You know why I hate you? Wait, what have I said differently than that in this conversation? What have I said different than what you just said? You are. He's not go goingna answer the question. He's not go goingna answer because he's having moment. He's notnna a moment right now to me that he's having his moment right now that fast. I get that. He's not gonna answer a question to me of all people, e too, Brutus or whoever the fucking saying goes, it's you two. Wait, it's not you two, it's u. What was it \n",
      "anyways? What did you say in the past? \n",
      "Well, if I had an army of simps, I would go through our last time we talked about it, and it felt like you were very dismissive and kind of put off the idea that Doctor K was doing something wrong as more of a conspiracy theory type of thing versus something that was actually in reality true. Okay. I don't think so. But you know, if I was to present you with a video recorded archive of you saying something that would classify as sweep adjacent for Mister K, soon to be Mister K, apparently there are no other active investigations or complaints, and they expanded the scope to every other conversation that they had with this review would have been a review of basically everything that's posted on the channel as well. Just for the. That's what Doctor K posted on the subreddit. That \n",
      "though the initial complaint was more limited, Doctor Keoha acts to expand the scope for all interviews and for his role during Reckful's acute phases. Actually, can we. Oh, maybe this just is for all interviews for reckful. Actually, I'm not sure. Can we read this? I think this is important to read. Read what? Whatever this post is. Can you read it? Hey, y'all. We want to update the healthy gamr community on the board complaint filed again. You're youing. You're doing the dismissive voice. I don't like it. I'll do it. Okay, hold on. Do not play the piano or overtalk me when I do this or I'll punch you. \n",
      "Hey, no piano. Stay the fuck clear. Actually, wait, hold on. You can play slow jam. You got 10 seconds to start reading. I'm reading. I'm reading. Hey, y'all. Very cheeky. We want to update the healthy gamer community on the board complaint filed against doctor Kay in February of 2022 by Mister Girl. Far before this complaint was filed, we took self corrective actions to address the most problematic aspects of guest interviews while still allowing for meaningful discussion around mental health. It continues to be an honor and a privilege to be able to do this work at scale and encourage thousands of people every day to take action towards better mental health. We're learning and growing too. Thank you for everything you have contributed towards making healthy gamer a force for good on the Internet. Doctor K's license has been reprimanded. While this is a disciplinary action, it does not come with any fines, penalties, or limitations to Doctor K's ability to practice medicine. It's not a suspension or probation. There's no restrictions. It also does not alter Doctor K's involvement with healthy gamer. Upon asking, the board did not require the removal or alteration of correspondence with previous guests or anything specifically related to healthy gamer. Out of respect for reckful, Doctor Kay has opted to keep things private and work with the board instead of engaging in public discussions. Though the initial complaint was more limited, Doctor K asked himself to expand the scope for all interviews and for his role during recfuls acute faces. The board is found that Doctor K acted with oh my God standard referral guidelines, including referrals for outpatient care, higher levels of care, and guidance around the use of emergency services. In private conversations with this one doesn't make sense. In private conversations with Brefful and his friends, the board is found that the interviews would recful constitute conduct that undermines the public confidence in theature. Sorry. In the integrity of the medical profession, the nature of healthy gamer interviews has been contentious for a long time. The interviews with reckful started in 2019. Before this complaint was filed in 2022, we had already taken steps to change how we did interviews. Over the past five years, we have formalized the process, which includes scheduling interviews in advance to avoid spur of the moment comments. Allow guests to formulate what they want to talk about and privately back out, offering guests a boundary setting call before the interview to specify off limits topics. Sometimes at this step, one or both sides determine the interview is too sensitive and it is canceled or postponed, always giving guests the right to have their interviews removed. This has been requested twice, and of course we've complied both times. We've established a scientific advisory board that advises or, sorry, that, well, they're incorrect here, they misrote that. Advise on policies, procedures for content, coaching, and other core activities. We understand and respect the board's decision and thank them for their thorough and fair assessment. \n",

That's the new thing. It's a fucking dead meme. I don't like that you guys couldn't fucking do it when destiny was around. Now it's happening to you, okay? And you can fucking sit in the queue waiting for a fucking month for Eris or someone else to fucking unban you on an o, okay? It's cringe and I don't like it. Okay? Second off, what'you think of that statement? Seems okay. I'yeah? I don't have any strong feelings about it. What about it? I think it's pretty dismissive of a lot of the statements that were made in the complaint. Like what statements? Well, I mean, let's go over the actual thing. Hold on 1 second. \n",
      "Was there any negative statement in the entire consent order? Besides, we feel like he's undermined confidence in the public health or whatever. Let's see. Well, I mean, the whole thing was kind of going over what he did was incorrect. Really? Which part? \n",
      "Let me pull it up. \n",
      "Wait, this was not. No, it is the love thing. Why is this not working? \n",
      "Okay. During the video, the respondent and recful engaged in a conversation addressing their discussion from January 23, 2020. The respondent acknowledged that his very bold claim about loving reckful for two years was irresponsible. Later in the video, Recful told the respondent he remained conflicted about this status and definition of their relationship. I would think that they're saying that that is a incorrect bad thing. Okay. The only thing that they say it is under the conclusions of law section. There's one part. It says the respondentents engaged in conduct that undermines the public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. That's it. That doesn't mean that every single thing listed on top of the findings of fact. It doesn't mean every single thing here was a bad thing or a breaking of the law or anything else like that. If you, like, read one of these things for Brock Turner, and at the end it's like, conclusion of law, the defendant, or, sorry, the defendant raped a girl, would you be like, well, that's it. That's the one thing we can do. He got off with no punishment, by the way. I think all of this needs to be. No, I have absolutely no idea what, what that sentence even meant. Okay. Brock Turner, you're familiar with that person? Yes. No. But I'm assuming he raised somebody and got off or something. Yeah, exactly. He got a very light punishment for raping someone. Okay. Correct. \n",
      "At the end of his, his charge, the conclusion of law, the defendant raped a girl. Right. Like, I don't understand. You're saying just because the conclusion is like, it's basically saying, hey, he's so'ignore. The fact that there wouldn't be, like, a conclusion a lot. This is, this is a consent order. So you're not go going toa find, like, so it's not a conclusion of all. There's, there's not going toa be a conviction at the end of an indictment. That's not how those work. Right, but'but, there isn't a conviction at the end of an indictment. No, there's not. Let me pull up rock turners is interesting. Isn't that usually what the jury returns guil ver? You're doing the like thing. You're doing the likeen thing right now. Okay, so I've justn the past, like, two months reading court cases, supreme court cases, you think I'm just gonna have no fucking idea. I could. Okay, look it up. Go ahead and look it up. Show me conviction at the end of an indictment, Dan. And then when you're done with that, tell me what a conviction is and tell me what an indictment is. We'll wait. Go ahead. Okay. A jury returns results saying that if on each charge, if the defendant is innocent or guilty, no. What does that have to do with an indictment? Well, this is a, this is like, at the end, there's like the one thing. An indictment is a charging document issued at the beginning, okay, to tell somebody they're being indicted for criminal charges. Okay? That has nothing to do with a conviction. Okay? At the end of, when you have documents like this, we have statements of fact. Okay? The statements of fact are being given. It's usually you're going to have a fact finding or you're going toa have statements of fact. They're going to show, like, here's like, a particular law and here are actions that this person did. And the conclusion from all of those actions, usually at the bottom of an indictment, you'll say that we feel like these laws were violated. Now, in an indictment, there'll be the criminal charges. At the bottom, I'll say these laws have been broken. That doesn't mean that every single fact listed was a crime that was committed. Right? Generally, \n",

These are just part, you don't know which parts of these. They didn't make a particular statement in the bottom in regards to any of the particular facts. It doesn't look like it. All we have is the respondent has engaged in conduct that undermines the public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. I haven't read these underlying cases. You saw some of the things quoted earlier. I don't know which parts of these given on the findings of fact. I don't know which parts of played into why they felt like he needed to be reprimanded. I can't make that assessment. And they didn't list it out here, and you certainly can't make that assessment. So I don't know why we're saying like, oh, well, obviously every single listed here, it's bad. I don't know what was listed here exactly. It's bad. I'm not sure. I can't tell. And they didn't give any guidance or indication on this about it. But it's just a consent order. So I don't know what you want me to. Yeah, okay. \n",

What would be your answer to that? Prior to. I don't know, the particular guidelines or the guidance it's given when it comes to. I didn't then I. Then it's hard for me to have an opinion of any high level conviction in the past. We have opinions about shit all the time without knowing, I think. And. Yeah, but they're very low conviction or sometimes just won't speak anything. I have no. Fuck out. Don say, I have no idea. I'm pretty sure somebody literally cameream yesterday and asked me things like, oh, what do you think about'like? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't know. This thing. I have no opinion about it. For this, I would say my guess is probably. It's probably gonna similar to where I just said that mister girl video from two years ago. Right? It's like u. You know, there's a huge conflict of interest. There could be really bad things happening. But maybe not, I'm not sure. But it would depend on what the pot guidelines given as part of your ethics classes or whatever the fuck when you're a therapist or psychiatrist. But I don't know what those guidelines are. \n",

No, to be clear. He got reprimanded and the punishment that he got is irrelevant here. Unless you want to say, do you think the punishment is irrelevant for the severity of a crime? Do you think that's true? Wait, say that again. The punishment doesn't matter for the severity of a crime. The punishment doesn't matter for the severity of the crime. No. Using the punishment to determine if the crime was a big deal doesn't. That's what you're trying to do. You're trying to say he only got reprimanded so it wasn't a big deal. Okay? That's what you are actually trying to do right now. He got a. Fuck it. He got. Just got reprimanded. It's not a big deal. And I'm saying I'm countering with. That's bullshit. Brock Turner didn't get much of a punishment, and he did something fucking hate. I don't know what Brock, turn. What is the. I don't know why you keep compare'the. Brock Turner.

      "This court case is about. Let's find out. Here we go. Brock Turner. There was a passed out girl behind a dumpster. He went behind it when he was drunk or not, and then he fucking was, like, fingering the girl. Two people found Brock Turner. They held him down. The cops came there, and then he basically got off with, like, no punishment at all. Okay, so he was initially indicted on five charges, two for rape, two for felony sexual assault, and one for attempted rape. The two rape charges were withdrawn, so now we're looking at two for felony sexual assault and then one for attempt rape. Played Don, killed all charges. The trial concluded, and he was convicted of three charges of felony sexual assault. Okay, what was his punishment? On June 2, 2016, he was sentenced to six months in jail, followed by three years of probation. Okay, so six months, did he. I didn't even think he got jail.

In December 2013, he was sentenced to ten years of probation, subsequently ordering him to undergo therapy for a long term inpatient facility.

So the first question is asking, well, what were they convicted of? To figure out particularly what they were convicted of. That's number one. Then the second thing that you would look up is you would go, okay, well, what are the sentencing guidelines for this particular thing? So, for instance, Dan is really mad that this guy got sentenced to what he perceives as a low sentence, but Dan has no, \n",
      "you're saying something that's incorrect right now. I'm not. Dan. Do you know what the sentencing guidelines are for intox manslaughter? Hold on. Are we talking about this guy or doctor K, right? We're talking about Ethan couch. I don't give a fuck about this guy. Then how do you know if his sentence was too big or too small? Because it was all over the news that he was drunk. And killed four people. And essentially he got off because the judge was friendly with his parents and that was the term. Sorry. Affluenza was coined. Do you see how you just dodged my question? Sorry. Repeat it. I don't want to dodge your question. What? Do you. Do you know what the sentencing guidelines are for in talks? Manslaughter. I don't know what they are. Okay. Texas. What if it was one month? Do you know what they are? No, I don't. That's why I was gonna look them up. So cocky at me if you don't. I'm not getting cocky. I'm not cocky because I don't know. And you don't know. I'm getting cocky because I don't know. When I went to look them up, you started laughing because you didn't even realize that you needed to know the sentencing guileance even know there was an improper sentence given? No. What's happening right now, okay. Is that you have no idea what the sentencing guidelines are. I don't know. That's why I went to look them up and you were making fun of me for it. No, I was waiting for you. I said keep. You didn't. You were like, o. He's just trying to throw it back to me. I just want to know the guidelines were. We could rewind the tape again if I want to. I said, no. Go ahead. Keep going. You said, no. No, I'm done. Actually. I'm done. Yeah, because you were saying this is way. He's trying to. You're trying to throw it back to me. I'm sorry if you. I'm more to continue to go and do research at this point. Would you like to. I don't even know what the. You don't even know any of the deals of this case. I'm just doing this my. For your edification now and for my own curiosity, doing me a favor. I understand. That's very. Yes, I am doing you a favor because you had no fucking idea what any part of this case was even about. You just heard mem in the media and that's it. The great part is you didn't have any idea either. I didn't, and then I went to look it up. But the problem is that you brought this up. It's an argument to support you. So, of course, I'm not familiar with it. But. You're not familiar with it either, but it's your argument. No. Yeah, I brought it up very. This is easy to explain. I brought it up because you are continually pointing at. Listen, you only got a reprimand, not a big deal. And I want toa counter with, hey, looking at whatever punishment someone gets is irrelevant to what crime they may have committed. There can be if you go back and you listen to what I said. Yes, yes. I. It's the court's opinion about the particular crime. That's why I keep saying mitigating and aggravating circumstances. There are circumstances that would make a judge lean more harshly against you, and there are circumstances that might make a judge more favorable towards you when it comes to sentencing. That's why you have aggravating circumstances that make a particular thing worse. Or mitigating circumst, that might make it a little bit better. Yes. Okay, cool. But generally, yes. So. And your own argument here, whether you realize it or not, playing in my favor. But you think it's playing in your favor because you're trying to say, oh, well, what about this guy who does a horrible thing and he got sentenced very lightly? Well, the reason why. The reason why he got sentenced lightly sounds like you're giving this affluenta reason. Sounds like it's because the judge fel that to be a compelling argument. So the judge felt like, well, the severity of these crimes is probably a lot more reduced because of this particular argument. Therefore, he's going to get a lesser sentence. Now, if you want to talk about, would you argue that this wasn't a big deal then if we were talking about this? When did I ever utter those words, ever? You're not even. You can't. You can't. You know what? I know. No, this is fine with me. I'm okay with this. Okay. Okay. You can be. I wish I could be on camera making the cute faces that you're doing with this. No, you re just. You're in here with a ton of conviction. You don't have, like, the slightest idea of, like, any part of this, but you have so much conviction. I do. Because you swept for this guy. I didn't, though. The video literally shows me saying that, like, oh, yeah. You know, I don't know. It could be huge. Compleque. Yeah. As I said, there is more research. O. Yeah, find me one. Fin the other stuff along those lines. I felt that you were, so to speak, sweeping for the guy, and now you're like, dan, not a big deal. If it was a big deal, he would have had a bigger punishment. And I'm trying to equate that fact, saying the punishment is not indicative of what the person did, being a big deal or not. And I'm giving you an example of that being a case, and you're being shot. You haven't given me any examples of that, because you're not going to, because what you're describing isn't how the legal system works. Okay? The guy who was drunk and killed four people and got away with probation, that is the situation that I'm giving to you right now. Okay? Y he got away with probision, and the reason why they had to make arguments in front of the judge was to try to show why this wasn't as severe as you think it is. My client didn't commit severe. You believe it wasn't severe, then what he did, it's not about, \n",
      "I'm asking you for your opinion on Doctor K, and you're saying, well, just reprimand, not a big deal. I want to know your opin my opinion, was it a big deal? I already told you, I don't know the guidelines, the specific guidelines that are given. So I don't have a strong conviction on any ofd. I said I don't know. It seems like it probably bad, but it would. The pen spec on shit that you don't know about again in the future. This is, you realize I literally pair every single speculation that I have, especially shit I don't know about, where, like, oh, I don't know. I don't know shit about this. I'm not sure. I don't know much about this part about new destiny is new destiny. Everything is. Well, it's my understanding, if I remember correctly. As long as I knew, like, that's the new destiny. Where's the old destiny, the one that fucking goes hard. I can't even get anything out of you. Yeah, because I have no, I don't know what the ethics guidelines are. Broro'psychiatrists, he might have ve been committing huge, grave wrongs, and he might have been to each other. Wasn't that big of a deal. Looking at the judgment from the board, it seems like they just decided to reprimand him. So it seems to lean in. The idea of it seems like they probably didn't think it was as big of a deal. \n",
      "So there's an ethics guidelines for psychiatrists, and then there's also an ethics guidelines for therapists when he falls under both of them. Just point that out. He would have to obey both of them. The ethics guidelines for counselors, therapists, they're stricter than for psychiatrists, interestingly enough. But \n",
      "I think that, I think that Dan has some good points, though. No, he doesn't. I do. You're a fucking Doctor K simp. And you just want to be on his next show so you won't say anything of fucking conviction for this fucking dick suck. Okay, from Doctor Kay's number one hater. Yes. No. Well, I'm like his number two hater. Or maybe number three. I think Chad really doesn't like him either. I'm on the list. I'm in the meetings. I'll say that much for sure. \n",
      "And you know what? I don't care. And the best part is every single fucking doctor K fan out there right now, especially those that are watching you, and they're fucking super butt hurt and doing their emotes and everything else, I'm glad that I'm riling you up. And I'm glad that today the post about him losing his fucking or gettingang of reprimand on his lice. See, even \n",
      "losing his fucking life, he'like, o fuck. Sorry that I said something. No, you didn't just say something wrong. It was a freudian slip. It's like, in your mind, like, it's like. Yeah, is when something's a Freudian slipped. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be ecstatic today as the news of doctor K being reprimanded goes viral and all of you and your fucking simps out there trying to fucking make it seem o. It's not a big deal. No worries. It's just a small reprimand. Me. Be happy. I'm glad. \n",
      "Okay. \n",
      "You can do your ayurveda, meditation, whatever nonsense. What do you want for that? Just have a quick question for Dan. No, I'm not. I am not doing this with a fucking Reddit mod. You stay back in your place. This is not your domain. Why do I terrify you all so much? There we go. You're using your jstock defense against me now? Are you gonna tell me that you're. What did he say? Other thing, the right bit. No, I'm not. Okay, don't do that. Did you read the whole court order? Yup. Really? To be clear, I would be careful. We're talking about a doctor case thing. Yeah, sorry, not court order. Yeah, I wouldn't call consent. Yes, a consent order, not a court order. This wasn't before court. It was just before the board of Medison. But'a licenseure reprimandmand, basically, yeah. Are those good? Just to be clear. So everyone is clear and crystal clear? To be clear. If we're all clear, are those good to have on your record? Yes. Does anyone know you've got strong convictionosed? Do you think House doesn't have any reprimands on his medical license? Dan? \n",
      "Do you know if House existed in real life, he would, like, be in jail and actually the worst doctor of all time because he would have killed, like, a thousand fucking people. W. You know house was house retarded, right? Oh, a house hater. Oh, we got a house hater in here, Dan, but he is a fucking retarded doctor, and everyone knows that. He. The fuck. He would be, like, a genocidal doctor if he was actually out there in the real world. House was a psychopath. So, Dan, is there anything in this, in their judgment, that could have changed your mind? Like, is there anything you could imagine them saying where you'd be like, oh, I guess Doctor K was fine. Yeah. If they came out and they said, this jury or whatever, at the end, if it said, we have found no wrongdoing, and that's it. That would be it. That'd be the end. That was a jury of his peers, and they found no wrongdoing. I mean, the end for me. So you're just really disturbed the public confidence and the integrity. That's what Dan cares about the most. Yes, of course. \n",
      "If I try to analyze why I'm upset about it, I think I'm upset about it because I feel like he got successful, wealthy, and made a career off of doing great harm initially, and then he pivoted to something else. Stepven, I currently. Apparently the audience can't hear me. Can you hear me? We can hear you. You're fine. Okay. Well, there's seething. All right. So you're. You're just a little quiet, that's all. \n",
      "Thank you for the honest feedback that I needed. Okay. I mean, he got away with it. That's fine. I mean, that's fine. I've gotten away with doing, like, illegal shit as well. With it. Yeah. What's the bending? Breaking the laws. The norms of psychology and psychiatry. Could you go into more detail? Sure. Nope. Wait. Oh, hold on. That was a very condescending thing that you just said to me right now. Yeah. Would you like to rewatch our initial debate about n 95? Hold on, hold on, hold on. We don't need to get sidetracked. I just want to know what. What are some of the details that you think the laws that Doctor K has violated and Norm said he's. Well, I think in general, the most important one is that you shouldn't have a relationship with your patient where they. The line between them being your doctor or your friend is unclear. Crazy. That's not called out in that document, in that consent order at all. So is that just your original opinion as a mental healthc care expert or professional or. I believe it is called out in the document. It's one of the statements that they make in there, that his relationship with him was inappropriate. Hold on. I'm sorry, I didn't see that. Was that. Yeah. Which Stman are you referring to here? Let me go through and find the exact thing that I said. Okay. I think I said this before, though. The respondent and reckful discussed the bounds of their relationship and whether the respondent was reckful'therapist or friend. Okay, so that was a statement of fact. Yeah, that's just. They're describing what happened. Let's go back a second. What are you trying to say in this document? Where does it, Dan, where does it say this? And I'm telling you, this is where it says that reckful in them were trying to determine if they were friends or therapists or not. I don't. What part of this. Okay, so what you're saying that the board said that that particular conversation, that particular thing is bad in this document? Do you think Doctor K wrote this document? Okay, what do you think it says? The finding of fact means? The finding of fat fact. You mean the conclusions of law section is what we're talking about? No, this statement comes from the finding of facts. \n",
      "Yes, it does. It's the. Yeah. What does that mean? These are a list of things that are true according to the board. Yes. Do you think there's a judgment in the findings of fact? There's a judgment in that these things happened and that they find them to be true. Yes. Yes. But they are that everything said here is like, for instance, you would say an example. Not that this is said here. They're describing events that happen. Yes. Ye. For instance, you could have something in here that could say on January 29, 2020, the respondent had sex with recful 15 times. That might be, but it wouldn't say that that was bad. Would you agree with that? Yes, that's correct. That's why we can move on from this subject then, because there's never gonna be that here. These are things that happened. Wait, you said. What did you just say? They're ever gonna say that's a particular thing that's bad. It's like you're trying to narrow me down. Say, Dan, it's not in the. It didn't say at the bottom that what he did is wrong. Those are just the problem is that, is that none of us actually know, but, you know, like, the least. But you have the strongest conviction. So, like, for instance, in a criminal indictment, I believe that at the bottom, when they list the charges, they do incorporate the facts into the charges. But that's in a criminal indictment. This is just a consent order. But I believe that that's not uncommon. I mean, we can look, I'm pretty sure. Jack Smith, federal indictment. This is. This is not a criminal thing. So I don't know if it matters. This is. You don't know anything about it, though. But you have a very strong opinion. That's the issue. You don't either. No, but I have, like, a little bit more of a, like, background and understanding what's going. Yes, apparently, yes. Yeah. Well, apparently not, because you were wrong. You thought he was wrong about what? About this. You thought what he was doing was fine. I don't think I've ever said that, but. Okay. Okay. But I'm sure you'll find the videos of that. I will. Okay. \n",
      "Count two, conspiracy destruction. Okay. The allegationsion paragraphs one through four and eight through 123 of this time are real electionged, fully incorate. Yeah, I think it's common in a. I think and most criminal indictments, that you'll be referring to parts of the facts above for which parts are incorporated or given in reference to the criminal counts or the criminal violation persons. But I don't know. For consent order, you probably rateite these however the fuck you want. Doesn't really matter that much. Okay. Are we good? Are we done from this? \n",
      "Are we done from this? Well, I was responding to forethoughts thing, so go ahead, forethought. Continue with your thing. Oh, yeah. I was just like. I was just, like, blown away by the conclusions you pulled from the fact finding part. When all this spoke to was that he undermined public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. It doesn't say anything about his relationship, his conflicts of interest or relationships with his patients. Yeah, there is a little bit of inference that you might need to pull. Like again, as we both agree, not that this happened 18 on February 20, 2020, Doctor K had sex with directful. Okay, you understand when you say inference here, you're not saying inference. You're saying you're going to make a judgment. Yes'going. To infer, detached from what these medical professors. No, no, no. Hold on. Take a second. The reason that these statements of facts are statements of fact is because they're relevant to the finding that they have at the bottom, they wouldn't put in here. On February 20 20th, Doctor K ordered a happy meal because that's irrelevant to the finding that he undermined the integrity of the medical profession. So all of the could, you could right, could be wrong, but it also could be. These were the things we examined. We only found issue with his undermining public confidence. They could be intentionally saying, we've looked at this, this, this, this. So we're not going to look at it again. Here's the issue. Here's the reprimand. You are being intentionally obtuse. What am I obtuse about? Okay, this is essentially a trial of Doctor K. Someone's reported you. Let's go through it. Here are the facts. And then they list out the facts. And you're saying none of these things. These facts matter. Even if. No, I'm saying they matter. Okay. So the facts has stated should. And then we have a conclusion at the end of the facts. Correct. At the conclusion of this is we found that you were bad. Basically. I'm paraphrasing here. I'm not going to say the same thing every single time. Okay. At the conclusion of all these facts is you were bad. You shouldn't have done that. Okay, now you're saying that I'm not allowed to look at any of the individual statements of facts and infer this is part of the reason. You absolutely can. Okay, so that's what I'm doing. You just shouldn't be saying infer. You should just be saying, I disagree with the board. These are my judgments. Well, I don't disagree with the board. The looked at, the board looked at his conduct as a whole and found that he was breaking their guidelines and he was reprimanded. What part of that is incorrect? Yeah. So do you think he was reprimanded for inappropriately behaving with clients? Yes. Okay. You're just wrong. Well, I mean, we can actually exact reprimand for. Hold on. Actually, I mean, I believe that that is the, \n",
      "that would be the. You're trying to. I understand what you're trying to do now. You're like, he wasn't done that. He was actually reprimanded for undermining confidence. I understand that you're making that type of very factual draw of that. But when we look at, you can ask me and I can explain. I'm thinking, well, I don't need to because you're just going to infer. Yeah, I'm going to infer from that. Oh, this is a pattern for you, I guess. Okay, you know what? I'll give you the benefit of doubt. Tell me how you know that his conduct with reckful was not related to this. Yeah, sure. So when I look at the fact finding, this was just a complaint specific to reckful, and at the end of it, they say that they have, he is engaged in conduct that undermines public confidence and the integrity of the medical profession. If he had specific issues with his relationships or he had conflicts of interest that betrayed his clients, or he had done something inappropriate with prescribing psychiatrics, I see no reason that they would be vague about that in any way whatsoever. \n",
      "You're inferring now that this isn't the answer that they give when. No, I'm not'actually'm. Notring. I'm reading the text'one hundred percent inferring that this response that they've given is not a blanket response regardless of what crime has been committed or what law has been broken or what guideline has been shattered, why you were inferring right now, why would they be vague? So are you asking me to speculate on why your speculation is incorrect? You seem it's speculation. I'm just reading the text and interpreting \n",
      "speculated that this is a very specific answer for a specific thing. I would love to know how you know that that's the case. \n",
      "For instance, if this was a case where a psychiatrist slept with a patient, and at the end of the conclusions of law, it was the respondent has engaged in conduct that undermines a public confidence in the integrity of medical profession. Would that shock you if there was a case like that and it was a similar verbiage at the end? Yes, that actually would shock me. I'm actually going to look up now and see if that's good. Think. I think you should. \n",
      "I don't know how you're gonna look it up, but maybe that's a phrase that has been used a few times. Let's try googling it. \n",
      "Bayed, any other beds in the chat? \n",
      "Okay. Oh, we got four of them. Here we go. Oh, this is so perfect. We have the exact same text for some other ones. You ready to pull these up? Oh, my God. Forethought this. They've used the exact same term. Isn't this sick? Okay, doctor who works at St. Vincent after doling out pot license illegally in Maine, he got that exact same term. That's weird. Can you link what you're reading? Because you can just google the text here. I will link you the exact Google search. But what you could do is actually just Google for the exact thing there. I'm reading case law, so. Oh, I'm sorry. That's my bad. I'm Massachusetts. Yes, it's. That's what I'm doing is really one to one. Yeah. Yeah. So it is exactly one to one. Okay. What are you doing? Well, I searched exactly for the term that was used to sentence Doctor K, if you will. And I found four cases here. So we're going through these and we're finding out each of these. 4k. No, we should keep going. You said this was not possible, right? You couldn't possibly use the same verbiage for crimes of a different magnitude. Forethought. We can go back if you want to listen to you saying it before. Every time you've asked to go back to watch something. It has never worked. That. Are. Are you trying to use this against you? Because you would be shocked if this was the case, plainly about what I think. So. Oh, okay. Let's hear what you think. If they think like, hey, this behavior violates and undermines public trust. And then point, point, point, point. Like, for instance, in this conclusion, Pembroke failed to discharge DL within the meaning of GL C 123 after the denial of his petition to continue DL's confinement. This was a violation of the statute. CGLC 123 underscore six, appendix a. In addition, Pembroke'number twelve, application of south for evaluation and subsequent readmission and involuntary of confinement was an abuse of misuse of section twelve. CGLC 123, part B, Megarney 502, Massachusetts, at page 784. What is called when people just spit words at you, hoping that miss. It's like what I expect to read when someone is violating medical procedure. Because you can read these cases all the time. There are anonymized cases of doctors that have either failed their basic duties or are being sued in some way. And they publish them that you can just read them. So when you, like, look at this and think like, oh, wow, they're making this sweeping conclusion about all this stuff in the background. You're like, you are in another realm. No, go ahead. You were saying? Yeah, I was saying. So we started this conversation, I believe you said verbatim, I would be shocked if this statement of fact was used for any other case at all or one that was serious. Do you disagree with my. You can do a retelling. Retarded retelling. Okay'you? Say, don't you state it. If there were violations of specific codes, they would not make a vague statement. They would d be wrering code specifically, which is why I'm reading this example. Okay, so would you like me to just like, start sending you doctors that have been sentenced? Like, there's one here for beating his wife. There's one here for. I'll send all of them to you if you want. There's actually a fuck to. Are you sending me random headlines or are you sending me opinions from case law? Each one of these is a PDF from a state sentencing, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. So you don't know. Okay, go ahead and link them. I think that pretty clearly says that. Go ahead, link. Go and link them. Go and link them. \n",
      "I don't think it really matters that he violated any specific code. If they found his conduct is unbecoming of a, you know, professional medical doctor and they reprimanded him for it. They said it violates public trust in the medical profession, which honestly, he does all the fucking time. The amount of lies \n",
      "he was claiming, he only studied like two to 3 hours when he was in medical school. He'just completely and utterly full of shit. And he says these lies because he thinks that it advantages him in some way. Like, the reason he came up with that lie was to make it seem as though he knows more about studying and can offer people advice about studying. He does that all the fucking time. So I think this reckful case is the only situation that I think his colleagues know of. Like they're not watching his YouTube channel and watching all of his content where he could violate some of these ethical codes. But I've seen him do that. Reg, his first case, the six pages on Doctor Lee. Yep. Can you read the. \n",
      "I'm not going to read out loud each of these things. Like there's so much stuff. Do you want to go through? Yeah, I mean, this is your evidence? My evidence is that there's multiple cases that use the same verbiage at the end. Yes. Okay, so in your mind, I thought that was novel, a novel conclusion from that board. In your mind. That's what I thought. I think that you thought that that response could only be possibly be given to a minor infraction. \n",
      "Okay, so you're going to go through these and talk about the major infractions, then. Say that again. Sorry. So you've linked a bunch of major infractions, I've listed infractions that use the same. Hold on, wait, real quick. Wait. Just because who's making an argument? I just want to see who I'm supposed to be back in here. What is the argument that's being made right now. So I ahead fourthought give your retelling. Yeah, sure. So basically this levy v. Board of registration of medicine allows. That's one what, Dan? That's one of the many that I gave to you, but go ahead. Yes. No, it isn't. Do you know what? Stop. Give me the argument before you guys get what is argument. Yeah, sure. So the case Levyv board allows the Massachusetts government to reprimand \n",
      "their practicing providers if they violate any sort of norm or rule or just engage in behavior that threatens public trust in health. Okay. \n",
      "I think that's normal. And I think that isn't a particularly damning accusation as it is just a rather light sentence and doesn't have a strict criteria on the healthcare that was provided or the quality of the profession. It's usually not a particularly severe thing in from what I can read, Dan, go ahead and make your case. Wait, can I rephrase this real quick? Just. Okay, so you're saying that a reprimand means that there was something that was done incorrectly, but it was relatively insignificant and the reprimand represents say like, hey, don't do this again. Are you fucked up? But it's not like a super severe thing in general, that's what you're saying. Correct. On reprimand, I'm not totally confident, I'm not exactly entirely sure what a reprimand can entail in terms of psychology and psychiatry. Sure. On this particular type ofere we just put people notice. Yeah, but in this particular case, it doesn't seem to be a huge deal and it's just the. The board making their case to ins ensure public trust. Okay, and what does Dan disagree with? \n",
      "Wait, sorry. What I'm stating is that the punishment that someone receives is not indicative of the severity of the crime. Okay. \n",
      "Do you disagree with that? That the punishment that someone receives is not indicative of the severity of the crime? You're just, you're, you're just. I'm asking you a question. There is noer reasonable mind. There is reasonable minds. It's a thing that reasonable minds can't justag around. The punishment that a person gets is of course indicative of the severity of the crime and the eyes of the court. Ok's, but if you disagree, you're just wrong. There's not even room for you to be. So when I give you an example of people doing heinous things and getting off with a slap on the wrist, you're like, well, you know what? That's an outlier. That's your thinking. Okay, do you not want to answer that? Like, for instance, the example of someone killing four people when drunk and getting probation. You don't even know what the ordinary sentences are for. Why are you putting this back to me? I'm asking you this question right now. I know that killing four people when drunk definitely carries prison time. You have no idea. I'm. Do you wantn bet money? Thousand bucks. Killing people while drunk has prison time. First time offender. Yeah. Or an a. You want to take me up on it? Guaranteed. You always say that if you're confident about something, put money behind it. Let's do it. Money behind it. That there's a guarantee that if I'm. You don't have to refra. You're posturingee. You're just wrong. You don't understand any part of the legal. I'm not gonna. I'm not gambling. You're gambling. You don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. Dan, do you admit that you don't know a single criminal statute or single sentencing guideline for anybody doing vehicular manslaughter? Can you admit that right now? Sounds like it's easy money. No. No. Can you admit what? No, because I'm not gambling. You're gambling. Admit you're gambling. You have no idea. Admit it. Admit it. You don't admit it. Admit what? Admit that you have no idea what the sentencing guidelines are for vehicular manslaughter. No. I know they come at least. This judge was completely out of line. The norm is that if you fucking kill someone when you're under a DUI, you go to jail, you don't get probation. Okay, there you go. As a minor, \n",
      "Ethan Couch was tried as an adult. I believe you believed. You don't even know I'mry. You're gambling. You have no idea what you're talking about. This is such. Okay, sorry. You go back to argue with for that. This is, you know what you do? You fucking weasel out un. Stop calling me a weasel, Dan. You didn't know about this case. This was after you dodge from another case you didn't know about because you to dodge the Brock toer one, you had no idea about that one you didn't even know orig what? This guy was sent for this case. Didn't even know he was a. No, you don't know anything about this case because you didn't know the exact name of the guy or what stated. Nobody's asking. Criminal Tr. Oh, my God. You did that exact behavior earlier. You're like where did it happen? Show me the exact law that he was lying or something that you were doing that you brought up a case to support your argument. And I asked you what the case was. And you so fuck you. So fuck it. You didn't even know the case. How? I did not see that. That's a valot thing for me to ask. That is not true. I knew the case. I knew it was a major thing that happened in America. The affluenza case. And you're like you didn't even know the name and the section of the law I was in. I knew that it was a kid that fucking killed four people when he was fucking drunk. Okay? That's what I know. Okay. And I know that he got off. And apparently someone messaging me right now says it's two to 20 years minimum sentence in Texas for killing one person when you're under the influence as a minor. As a minor? No. I don't believe that. That's correct. Meaning 16 to 18. Well. You can put some money on it. Okay. $100 fine. You're on. Okay. Here's a thing linked for penalties for drunk driving. Vehicular homicide. Somebody can link the actual link for this. In some states it says zero to 24 years. I don't even know if these are minimum sentences. This is approximate jail or prison sentence possible. \n",
      "I feel like I see like 20 states here. 000-00-0000 where'pisco? What's Texas say there? Texas is one state in the US. What state did this happen in by the way? Oh. I'm sorry. We talk. We're only talking about the state of Texas. I'm sorry. Do we want to change the rules now? You never specified that as a rule. You said. Oh, wait. Okay. Hold on. No. No. You're right. Right. Wait. Wait. Let me just. Yeah. You're right. No. No. Waitah. You're right. Hold on. I'm sorry. So when you were saying you were so confident about the minimum sentencing guidelines. You know the minimum sen. But only for Texas. Not for any other state. I was talking about this specific case. You know what's funny is you can take this argument and you can go either way with it. That's why you're such an effective debater. Either it says two to 20 for Texas or it says zero to 20. But either way you can either fall back and say, oh, I'm sorry. Every state doesn't accept Texas. My bad. Or it can be Texas hasing and say, Dan. This is really weird. Texas doesn't have it. But the other ones do. I thought that is the type of debate pedophile tactics that you try on fucking weaker minds. Not on me, \n",
      "Dan. Out. \n",

      "Just as a heads up in case anybody is confused, because there's a lot of retarded statements that were made. Okay. Just is a real quick thing when you're reading statements of fact and then you've got charges at the end, right? Unless it calls it out specifically. The thing is, you don't know on the factual statements. You don't know which one of these things or how they're contributing to the charge of it. Doesn't list it particularly, or if you're not familiar with how these particular charges are levving. So, for instance, let's imagine a very simple charging document, and it says, Stephven had a conversation with John about killing Jane with a firearm. The next day, Stepven and John went to the store to go and buy a firearm. And then the next day, Stephen and John went and they killed Jane with the firearm. And then the charge is like a conspiracy to commit criminal. Conspiracy to commit murder, I guess. And then murder whatever. Murder one or whatever, right? And there's probably other things too, right? If you're looking at all the three things that have happened, okay? And you're looking at the conspiracy charge, right, for conspiracy. I believe that for. I think this is in every state, for conspiracy to commit a crime, I think you need to make the plan to commit the crime, and then you have to take at least one step towards committing the crime. I think these are two elements, maybe the only two elements involved in criminal conspiracy. However, if you're looking at a charging document, right, me and John having a discussion about killing somebody with no steps taken towards the crime is not part of a criminal conspiracy. And me and John going to the store to buy a gun is not part of the criminal conspiracy. But having both of these together makes it part of a criminal conspiracy. That's why you can't just read a statement \n",
      "is wrong where every single line thing is a bad thing. It might be, but it might also be taken in conjunction with one another. I don't know the therapist, the guidelines for ethics, whatever. So I can't make a strong statement or declative statement. But I would never say that because charges follow from some statement of facts. Therefore, every single fact constitutes on its own in a vacuum of bad behavior. You can't make that statement unless you're more familiar with the particular guidelines. You can't make that statement from a charging document or from a consent order or anything else. You just have no idea. You don't know. \n",

You don't even know what you're talking about when you're making the argument. There's no point in. I'm not. I'm not gonna say, you do live research, you know, you fucking weasel fuck.

The open has become more like one of our british coronations. Clearly, I'm not advising her campaign, but I would say the specter of Joe Biden is probably the last thing she needs right now. She wants to close the gap on former President Trump. Harris will campaign as a black female leader with a compelling message about a prosecutor against a convicted felon. She's 19 years younger than Trump. Like Biden, she can often be incoherent. But unlike Biden, the words coming of her mouth are the ones she intended to use. As unpopular as she may be, a candidacy has a potential to stoke the liberal base. Wait, I'm sorry, is he reading from some conservative pundit, or are these his original thoughts? Wait, what gap on former President Trump? Harris will campaign as a black female leader with a compelling met has become more like one of our british coron pouring is cruising to the nomination. Democratic titans like Nancy Pelosi and St. George Clooney have endorsed her. Donations are pouring in. Now she has the delegate to see how many serious challenges too. Theland convention has become more like one of our british coronations. Clearly, I'm not advising her campaign, but I would say the specter of Joe Biden, it's probably the last thing she needs right now. She wants to close the gap on former President Trump. Harris will campaign as a black female leader with a compelling message about a prosecutor against a convicted felon. She's 19 years younger than Trump. Like Biden, she can't often be incoherent. But unlike Biden, the words coming out of her mouth are the ones she intended to use as unpopular she may be at the moment. A candidacy has a potential to stoke the liberal base of win over voters. He saw Biden's campaign as an increasing fast. That's why Trump supporters should be careful what they wish for. I have suggested that the president should resign. The reason is if everyone acknowledges that he is incapable of running a campaign, then he's clearly incapable of running the country. I mean, he has the nuclear codes. He has major decisions he has to make every single hour of every day, and he does not have the faculties to do so. Now we are suggesting and calling upon him to resign to be the right thing of the country. Well, right. Of course, there are very serious questions about Biden's fitness for office. Some of us have been asking them for years, even the Democrats are shortest. That he was so sharp he could slice concrete. But acting up anal office could benefit Kamala Harris, just as the omnich shambles Ab Biden can only benefit Trump. The best strategy for the former former president may be the one who's tended to like the least. To stand back and let the lunyatics run the asylum for now. Or not. Talk to Bill O'Reilly about all this. The first debate, I'm joined by the host \n",
      "Dave Smith and Chris Murray. From Chris and Harry unplugged, I know you've got to leave fairly soon, so I want to start with you. Is it republican interest that Joe Biden lingers around like a bad old smell for as long as possible? Yeah. Care for what you wish for. I think there's two parts of this. Look, I would love to see Joe Biden be okay. And I mean that from a health perspective. The fact he's been hiding, that we haven't seen him, I'm glad that apparently he's doing better and he's going to address the nation tomorrow night. At the same time, if he's clearly incapacitated, you need someone to actually be the acting president. The United States of America, not a de facto president, which is what Kamala is right now. Look, there's a ying and yang here. If you see KaMaA president as a helper campaign, maybe. But if she's the Kamal Harris that we've learned to know. I think it could also just be a disaster for a presidential campaign. It's truly a coin flip at this point. So, yeah, be careful what you wish for in one aspect of this. But the same time, it's like, all right, let's see what Harris looks like. I don't believe it's a great product. I don't believe she's going toa be a great president if she's filling in. I thinks, what's going on in Bangladesh? I have no fucking do. What's going a disaster? When you see her on stage, and I think she's unlikable. And the Democrats decide that in the last presidential primary they had with her, they didn't like her, they didn't vote for it, they didn't support her, they didn't give her money. This is the coronation now. So let's see Kamal Harris. I think she's run the country right now, so let's let her have the job. Okay. I mean, Francesca, I watched Kamala Harris's first big speech yesterday, the one where Biden called in the contrast. Tim or two of them couldn't be a be more glaring. I mean, Biden just sounded like a very old man dodding his way through a sort of call to wish everybody well. She did look the part. I mean, she's very telenic. She's obviously intelligent. She was warm, she cracked some jokes. She had a few zingers about Trump. And whilst everything Bena said is true, everything changes when you become the presidential candidate for your party. And there is a chance here for the Democrats to have a massive and dramatic reset. If she plays it right. I mean, yeah, even if she plays it wrong, peers. I mean, even if she can just end as full sentence and be nominally coherent, she's a much better option for not just democratic voters, but I think independents and undecided who obviously see her see Donald Trump. They know all the drama that comes along with him, and they're like, yeah, let's go with this. Let's take a chance. But look, I think this is a massive win for Trump. I don't understand why the rights'not happier. Okay. Donald Trump beat Joe Biden and not a single ballot was cast. Boom. I like, I don't know why this is not more of a cause for celebration. I understand that your superman does have a kryptonite, which happens to be black female prosecutors, you know, Tanya Chutkin and Leticia James, Fanie Willis. And now, oops, Kamala Harris, but I still think you should just take a win. I love know there's a lot of whining going on, and I don't get it. Like, in no world does, like, a baseball team get to sue another baseball teamuse like, they put in a left handed relief pitcher instead of a righty and they were preing for the righty. What's going on? Yeah, but this is, let me say this in response. It's not whining. This is different. And republicans know it's different because, number one, the media is about to give a billion to 2 billion in in kind donation to Harris campaign with a 30 day democratic convention telling everyone that she is amazing. Number two, perspectives change. If you're on the Titanic and you hit an iceberg and there's a really crappy little dingy boat in the middle of the water, that boat looks amazing to you in that moment because it's a life raft and it might save your life. That is Kamala Harris'campaign right now. You're compared to a ship that's going down, and the only thing that can possibly save you is that crappy little ship in the sea, which you'll be in love with for the next three or four months. So waing. \n",
      "So I love your analogy. And I just, let me just. Does that mean that Donald Trump is the iceber? No, that's not what I said, and I think you know that. No iceberg. Donald Trump. Okay. Dave Smith? Yeah, well, look, I mean, I think that there's a lot of relief amongst democrats right now because they were very concerned with the problems that Joe Biden has as a candidate. The issue is, look, there's a reason why we've all been speculating about Gavin Newsom and Hillary Clinton. And from the very beginning, when there was always a question mark over whether Joe Biden would make it or not, there is a reason why people skipped over Kamala Harris as the next option. And the reason is because she's a deeply unpopular vice president. She has never been a great political candidate. And the reality of the situation is that despite the enormous spin that's going on right now, it is not true that Joe Biden made some decision that his country is more important than him. He fought everyone until the very better end. Kamala Harris has a serious uphill battle right now. To be clear, just to be ultra clear, because conservatives and fascy fucking russian paid stooges like this fucking loser will try to spin this in the most chaotic way possible so that they can make the most amount of money possible and the retards to consume their content. Right. Biden didn't have to step down unless the DNC could have, like, forced him to, which would haveass me, but I could have just held on and fought to the bitter fucking end. Like, Donald Trump 1 billion% would have. So this idea that, like, oh, like, you know, yeah, they may blahah. No, Biden chose to step down. That's a really, really tough call for literally anybody to make. Okay, to literally say, you know what, I'm not going to run again. I'm going hand over the reins on my incumbency, my presidential election rerunning. I'm gonna hand over the reins on that and give it back to other people. Was there a lot of pressure on? I'mnna do it. Yeah. Did he initially resist? Yeah, of course. But the fact that he ended up doing it is, I think, is pretty significant. But people will rewrite this as though in whatever retarded, like, pigs sloth way they want to try to beat Donald Trump. She's only got a few weeks till convention. I'm not saying this as a Trump supporter who's whining. I'm just looking at the situation in front of me. Donald Trump is the overwhelming. Yeah, I think that'that's, completely true. And certainly in the swing states. Joe Walsh, what do you make of it? And I can't ever remember a period in american polit. I don't know who that person on the bottom right is, but this lady is fairly based. She's kind of progressive, but still fairly based. She hates Trump, at least progressive, that hates Trump. And our boy here is uber based. True. And certainly in the swin states. Joe Walsh, what do you make of this? And I can't ever remember a period in american politics quite like this in my entire lifetime. I was born in 1965. It's absolutely extraordinary, a series of events. The fact that there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump where he was hit by bullets, and we're not actually leading with that so soon after it happened is remarkable. But it's a very fast moving thing, this. And the thing about politics is momentum can play a big part. Trump has arguably, you could say, peaked way too early here in this campaign. You know, everything's riding well for him. He's doing great. The comeback is in place. It's all secure. Looks like he can't lose. But as he said to me on the phone on Saturday night when we spoke, four months is a very long time in politics. We've just seen what can happen in three weeks? You know, three and a half weeks ago, there was the debate to come and Joe Biden was telling everyone, I'm going to take Trump down at the debate. Well, you know, three and a half weeks later, he's gone. So anything can happen here. What's your reading, Joe, of where we are in P. I agree 100%. We are living in unprecedented times. I mean, the past eight to nine years, three and a half years ago, a sitting president lost an election and he still hasn't conceded and he tried to overthrow an election. You're right. We had an assassination attempt on a president just a few weeks ago. So, yeah, these are crazy, unprecedented times. Look, this isn't complicated. I don't, he's got a comfortable lead. Joe Biden wasn't going to beat him. The Democrats found another candidate and she has a legitimate shot at, at challenging him and beating him. I think the factor that all of us have underestimated, no matter where you stand on her as a candidate, is the enthusiasm. There was zero enthusiasm for Joe Biden. Kamala Harris, any other char agree would have generated. That's a wild card. That's all. That's a wild card. It's a reset. Heres the whole election. Let me bring backnn. I know you've got to go in about four minutes, Ben, so let me, what is wrong? Is my, is something wrong with my mic? Nope. You're getting audio banned. \n",
      "Give this, Ben, I mean, the money's been pouring in for Kamala Harris in record levels. If you believe what the Democrats are saying, 18, 90 million within 24 hours. Right. You can cast a skeptical eye over the exact number. But clearly the democratic machine is now pouring behind Caramamela Harris. That will in itself energize the race in a way that Donald Trump would not have had to have dealt with if it was still CP Joe Biden. So I think there's a new challenge for, you know, if I was advising Trump, but I'm not, but if I was, I would say then be very careful about going to ad hominem on Kamala Harris. You know, I would stick to her policies. I stick to her record. You know, this is a woman who believed in defunding the police. This is a woman ultimately who was made the immigration czar and said don't come in and 8 million people came in. Right. So there are lots of ways you can go after Caramala Harris about her record. I think if Trump tries to do what he often does and go add hominein with her, he could backfire. Sure. Look, I think, I think this is a blessing that she is now going to be nominee, that this isn't going to be an open convention because otherwise, who you campaign against the next 30 days of the convention, right. You do 20% of the time with Kamala, 10% Havein Newsom, 5%. You know, withish Shiro. I mean, this was going to get really complicated. Now Joe Biden is gone. Donald Trump knows who he's running against. It's Commamaa, you stick to her record and why's on. She's so unpopular with the democratic party. But this is also appear so different. The media, it was so depressed. The democratic party was so depressed, the donors had dried up the money for Joe Biden, they forced him out. Somebod even described as a soft coup where if you don't resign 25th and you're going to have some serious problems, he goes into hiding. Soft coup. We're talking about who has the nomination from the political party, the democratic party. Not absolutely no part of this at all is a soft coup. There was pressure for Biden to step down, but he's not guaranteed. There'no law, by laws, regulations that guaranteed him the democratic nomination to run for president. X any other country, this happens. Our State Department say we think \n",
      "in the primaries \n",
      "in 2020. But I don't know if I would say she was, like, uniquely unpopular. I think there were a decent number of o. I'd have to go back. But I think the popularity for the big progressives was kind of split between, it would have been Kamala, Elizabeth Warren, and I think Bernie Sanders. I think all three of them were very, very, very progressive in terms of how they ran. And chances are you're going to go for Bernie or maybe Warren. I don't know why you would pick Kamala over those two. That's my recollection. It's been a while, but on another nation, and now we're at this reality. And I think what Democrats understand is this is their lifeboat. This is their second chance at holding on to power. So every mega donor says, we want to keep power. Everyone in around the White House that knows, comma, we want the power. Every congressman that's running for reelection desperately needs a better candidate. A ballot matters to down ballot races and every other senator wants to keep \n",
      "is completely and utterly worthless. It means nothing. Do I believe that Donald Trump has a lead? Yes. But it's worthless because this is a total reset. It's a completely new race we've never seen before. In american political history. It is a race to the finish. It's going to be something we've never witnessed. Now, if you're Trump, you stick to the basics. The economy, stupid. Kamala Harris says Joe Biden 2.0. She's unpopular and she's going to give you exactly what you just saw for the last four years. But he has got to stay focused because the one thing I'll say is the media is going to treat Kamal Harris like she's preincetss Diana for the next three and a half months. They will never betray her. She is now a beauty queen and they lover. Well, you can see that. And it does feel like a coronation. That may not be the smartest move by the democrats to make it look like they basically riden roughshod over democracy to make her the queen. Just to be clear, when they say ridden roughshod over the democracy and that this is a coronation. So Kamala Harris was voted on the same ticket as Biden to be president and vice president of the United States. They won that election. It was a nomination that was won in 2020 for the Democratic Party and then it was a general election that was won in 2020. It's not. None of this is a coronation and none of this is just chosen arbitratly like they won that past election. But Joe, you want to jump in? Yeah, just quibble on that one point, Pierce. Look, a coup is when you lose an election and try to overthrow it. That's a coup. A president deciding not to run. No, hold on, let me finish. Then jump in. A president deciding in this notion, Pierce, of a coronation. What do you think about Alex O'Connor's pro Trump posts? No, he's not doing it. Is he too decided not to run? Any Democrat could have thrown their hat in the ring. This isn't an election, it's a primary. That the primary voters pick delegates. The delegates at the convention pick the nominee. This is not a coup. And any other Democrat could jump in and challenge her last. Let meselfn. Benn, do you have to go? Can you wait a couple of minutes or what's your do? I've got three more minutes. Yes, all let Ben have his final blast back at Joe and then we'll the rest. I read this, I read this yesterday and it came from an elected official and it said, quote, if this was happening, referring to what's happening on politically in any other country, the State Department would be calling this a coup attempt. The president in hiding president, no pictures of him, letterhead that doesn't have a presidential seal, a signature that's been underlined, that the president doesn't typically do, and yet we're acting like this as normal. Joe Biden was what? This is what, who wrote this? Is he quoting an anonymous, him and his friends on discord cooked this up? Or who was he quoting? If this was happening, referring to what's happening on politically in any other country, the State Department would be calling this a, and it said, quote, and then we'll read this. I read this yesterday and it came from an elected official. And it said from an elected official from some dipshit Republican in Congress. Is that what he's saying? Quote, if this was happening, referring to what's happening on politically in any other country, the State Department would be calling this a coup attempt. The president in hiding been underlined that the president doesn't typically do, and yet we're acting like this as normal. Joe Biden was forced out.

      "brain did a coup July. He didn't want to leave. He did not want to leave. Days before he was saying, I'm in this, I'm in this. And I think this was clearly the cabinet and other Democrats that said, we're either, you're either going to leave or we're going to force you out. You are done. And now we've got a president that's going to talk to the nation tomorrow night. I'm sorry. This happens in another country, we'd all be talking about, you can literally, they, \n",

Technically for the Democrats like there, what is being cooed here? The coup that's happening is on the democratic primary this way. But we're actually like it. This is not normal'funy about you, Ben. What's so funny about Republicans is that this would never happen because their God Emperor Donald Trump can literally do whatever he wants and \n",
      "no one would step out of line to say, you shouldn't be president anymore. And you're so jealous the Democrats actually hold their own account. You're so jealous that we'd actually like, be like, hey, you know what? Maybe shouldn't run against'party right. It's just so funny. It's like if you lose in November, you can run him again. \n",

      "Let me jump in, let me jump in. Let me jump in. I just want to this gu fucking base you out. We had a panel on Wix stream a couple weeks ago. He is based, we don't actually know the motivations of a shooter, but if you want to look for blame, this 20 year old deranged kid with AR 15 was able to unload bullets of President Trump. It's because the secret. Hang on. It's because the Secret Service dropped the ball in such spectacular fashion and left Trump exposed so badly, which could have led to him being killed and should have done really. It was a miracle he survived that. The director, SIG Secret Service Kim Sheetler today resigned or probably been fired a week. And so that is probably where my main blame would go. Is there failure to protect the president? No, we listen, hang on the St. Joe, we've got to say goodbye to Ben to be respectful to his time. Ben, thank you very much indeed for coming back and uncensored. I appreciate it. But joined by Chris Murray from the Chris and Harry unplugged. And I'll come to see J Pieron as well. But Dave Smith, you've been sitting next to me here, even though we're looking down barrels of different cameras. You wanted to get in there. You aghast about something. I'm not quite sure what it was. Well, look, okay, there's just a couple things here. First of all, I do understand to the use of the term coup, however, for Joe to say, well, this was just. Joe Biden made a decision like, yeah, that's pretty misleading. Also, the truth is that Joe Biden did make his decision. His decision was to stay in the race. He made this very, very clear up to Sunday morning. On the Sunday morning news shows, campaign surrogates were going out saying he's staying in the race. It's Biden verse Trump. Now, it's not exactly that he made a decision. Big donors and political operatives and the corporate press all turned their back on him and said, we are going to force your hand. And essentially he was forced out on top of that. Look, I'm not claiming to know anything that we don't know. It is incredibly bizarre that the president of the United States of America, a few weeks out from the convention, decided to pull out of the race and did not address the nation. Now, you can say he had Covid, I don't care. He's the sitting president of the United States. For it to come out on personal stationary. And then in a tweet, he endorses Kamala Harris. And now we're being told we're go going toa hear from him tomorrow night. That is just incredibly bizarre. And it, it is understandable why people speculate about what was really going on behind the scenes. The truth is that none of us really know what of ##ternal pressure was put on Joe Biden, what type of threats were made. So the fact that people would speculate about that I think is totally reasonable. On the other. Yeah, speculate about ye, about him being secretly dead. And now we've got to do people, a group. Yeah. Jesus. It is kind of weird that there's like no public statement or anything like that. But also apparently, I mean, if he has Covid and shit, they might want to not have him come out and give an address while literally something he'go goingna die. But I mean, I don't know the rationale for that other point. The idea that Republicans are \n",
      "from the left is that it just reality flies in the face of it. Look, there was a national review, entire issue dedicated to never Trump. In 2016, Mitt Romney, the previous nominee, came out and gave a speech. Anyone but Donald Trump. This year, all of the big donor money was going to DeSantis and Nikki Haley. All of the powerful forces within the republican establishment have been trying to get anybody else except Donald Trump. The difference between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is that Donald Trump, however you feel about him, has tens of millions of Americans who love him and want him to be the nominee. And there's no Democrat who has anything like that. Agree. CJ being a CJ'been. Waiting patiently. Hang on, hang on. Come to a moment. CJ Pearson. Can you tell me what brat means? Given it's the word that's all over the news and you're probably the only one young enough on the panel to know what it meanse as the resident J deer here. Yeah, it seems as if Kamala Harris is having a brack girll summer, which actually means that she actually doesn't know what's going on. It's a state of deliriousness. It's a state of delusion. It's like you're just going along to get along. But that's kind of how Kamala Harris has led her entire political career. She's just been, wait, am I misunderstand? I don'tand. Wait, what does this have do with being black or black girl summer? Did I miss something? Hold on. Can establishment have been trying to get anybody else excepts of millions of Americana DJ'been? Waiting patiently. Hang on, hang on. Brat. What is think brat or black? What? I come to a moment. CJ Pearson. Can you tell me what brat means, given it's the word that's all over the news and you're probably the only one young enough. Was it brat girl Summer? And also know what it means freah as the resident Jin Zere here. Yeah, it seems as if Kamala Harris is having a brack girlll summer, which I. Why are you guys think that sounded like black girl summer? I can't tell you. Fuck. I wish I had a better way to keep track of you guys to. It's a new. It's an album. Okay. As the resident Jin Zere here. Yeah. It seems as if Kamala Harris is having a brackll summer, which it sounds like he's saying brack bl black. I actually can't now I can't even tell what he's fucking saying as the resident Jin Zer here. Yeah, it seems as having a brack girl summer, which I haven't. Don't. I actually don't know now actually means that she actually doesn't know what's going on. It's a state of deliriousness. It's a state of delusion. It's like you're just going along to get along. But that's kind of how Kamala Harris has led her entire political career. She's just been a coconut falling from a coconut tree. She just lands in a place in hopes that the american people will go along with it as this coordination has taken place. You know, Dave absolutely had all the right points. Donald Trump went through a spirited republican primary process where he knocked every single one of them out one by one. What's happening right now, which is so ironic and so hypocritical. Is that the party that is supposedly so against voter suppression is now disenfranchising millions of Democrat voters who voted for Joe Biden to be their nominee. They bully a senile old man out of office just so that they could have a chance at winning in November. It's disgusting, it's wrong, it's anti democratic, and dare I say, it's a threat to democracy. Y. I love that. And every accusation is a confession. Jesus Christ. How you choose people during a nomination. Remember that \n",
      "super delgates for Hillary Clinton was stealing the democratic process when people dropped out. And then all the primary voters started to support Joe Biden, and Joe Biden was giving positions in administration of Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. This was also a coup. And this was like, contraating the democratatic process. All of these things'every, no matter what they do, it's always a violation of the democratic process. Always. When it's the Democrats, when it's the Republicans, they can do absolutely no wrong. Oh, you should vote Joe Biden. Vote. Show. You should bring him back into the race. Hang on, let me go to Chris. Let me go to Chris from Chris and Harry unplug. He's also been waiting a long time to get in here, probably even younger, so knows even more what brat means. Come Harris. I mean, what do you make of the new threat to Donald Trump? He's got to tear up his entire playbook, which was to beat an old guy to now go after a much younger black woman's a completely different proposition for Trump. What do you think? Yeah, I think, I think Republicans in Trump are panicking. And I think you've seen it in the last ten or 20 minutes. If they want to run, if the pr play for Republicans wants to be that Democrats are a threat to democracy, that Democrats are doing something undemocratic, Donald Trump and Republicans like CJ Pearson want to run on that. I think Democrats are in a great position in November. They have nothing. And to the last point about, you know, everybody in this party has to bend the knee to Donald Trump. CJ Pearson would not be sitting where he is if he didn't go and praise Donald Trump and have a Trump banner in his header. I mean, CJ, somebody who, in his primary election that he lost, he called voter fraud against his republican counterpart. And so, you know, in the Democrat world, we've had fierce debates about our candidate. And it's been hard, but we value, we have values and morals that actually matter over just bowing the need to \n",
      "than anyone in political history. You know, know, I wouldn't expect from a DNC page show like Chris Malwry. But what I'll say to this is that Kamala Harris has nothing more than a pandering shadow, and she is the same in the same situation that Joe Biden is, and she is not running the show whatsoever. And what she'll realize is that brack girll Summer will not be enough to change the hearts and minds of America's young people. Because under Kamala Harris, what you won't have as a black girl summer, what you will have is a broke girl summer, as a result of the runaway inflation that we're experiencing, or the Biden Harris administration, as a result of the record high gas prices we've seen under their administration, their leadership is absent of any leadership. Then you got nothing to worry about, CJ. Then CJ, if you're right, if Kamala Harris is nothing, you should be smiling. You should be celebrating right now. You'got nothing, nothing to worry about celebrating. I am smiling. Good. I mean, yeah, that's what I think is sort of just incredible about that. Just two things I'll push back on, you know, the idea that it's a coronation once again in 2020. Panel, how many primary challengers did incumbent President Donald Trump had? O true, true, true, true, true that challenge. And also in 2024, remember, Donald Trump did not actually fight any of the other campaigning people. He didn't fight Nikki Haley, he didn't fight DeSantis. He just went around, he did some rallies. He avoided every single debate challenge, every challenge to appear on stage with them because he didn't want to actually contend with any of them either. But Republicans never had a single issue with any of that. Crazy, huh? None. And two other, because he was the incumbent president. This is an incumbency, right? And so the idea that this is like, how dare they all talk? It's not democratic. No. Harris is the effing vice president. Been on the tickensids. Joe Biden was elected back in 2020. Obviously, people thought he was going to be the incumbent and run again. Then his brain did a coup on his body and himself and his whole campaign. And here we are, where we are. The other thing about the donors, I think it's very funny, because the reason that Donald Trump on the other side picked ya boy JD Vance, even though he hates facial hair, is because JD Vance came along with a bunch of venture capitalists, guys like Peter Thiel, Mark Andreessen, David Horowitz, to absolutely help this campaign out with all of their AI funded tech, crypto billionaire money that wants to put us all out of a job in three years. This will just be a panel of AI experts and honestly, God bless them. Well, we have Chris Mar on the panel. I don't think there's any robot in the world that could mirror what you're like. Francesca, I have to say, I think your position is safe. True. Over here. AI. CJ. CJ. Let me just ask CJ and I'll come to Dave also joining on this. When you look at Kamala Harris, like I said, if, if Trump goes ad hominein, which is his normal preferred method of attack on any opponent, I think it could backfire. However, there is lots of stuff on Carmela's record which I think he can really pick her off about. Most notably, the fact that she's been the immigration CSAR for the United States of America for the last two years when immigration has been running completely out of control. If I was trying, I just keep asking, didn't you just have one job? Wasn't that the job you had to do? Yeah, to unilaterally execute legislation on the border. And then when she was asked if you'd been to the border, she came out with this extraordinary response. Well, haven't been to Europe either. As if that was anything relevant to the discussion. So I think the way she's handled the one thing she was given special responsibility for, if I'm the Republicans, I'm going after that morning, noon and night. No, PS, I think you're absolutely right. I think we do find ourselves in a whole when we continue to talk things about her sexual history and all those things. I think there's no need to discuss those things. I think there are a lot of other things that are disqualifying about Kamala Harris, including her blatan hypocrisy. You know, she locked up countless of nonviolent young black men for smoking weed, only to go to the breakfast club and brag about how much weed she smoked. This is also someone, as you said, who was in control of our national security as it relates to the border and absolutely droped the ball their time and that she is not deserving a promotion. The only reason that we are even having this conversation on her as a nominee of the Democrat party, aside from a coordination, is because she's a DEI hire. She was a DEI hire once she became vice president because he had to get black women on board this campaign. They couldn't skip over colal my hairs because they were afraid of upsetting black women. If they did so that is exactly why she bided her time. She covered up the fact that Joe Biden was mentally unfit and mentally unwell and mentally incapable of carrying on the ban of democratic party because she knew that she could not win an open democratic prim herself. She knew that she did not have the fortitude to do so. And we saw that it was demonstrable in 2020. She didn't win a single primary state. She didn't even make it to Iowa. Pes and if you think that if she can't beat Pete Buttigieg and all of those folks, Tulsi Gabbard, you'd think that she can beat Donald J. Trump after what he has endured, after the feckless prosecutions, after the attempted assassination, then, you know, I've got some great real estate. Alask is iue. It's insane. Okay, let me bring in, I want to bring in Dave Smith about one particular point. I saw one of the polls today, which was matching up Carmela Harris against Trump significantly amongst young people, a big gap between them, and \n",
      "feel that what Trump did when he was shot was a remarkably ballsy thing. And it became a really big social media sort of emblem of defiance and strength and courage and all these things which were things that maybe young people hadn't associated with Trump. This is a real quick thing. And people are saying, oh, this doesn't make that much of a difference. Or everybody knows this. They don't. I see it in Alex O'Connor post, too. Okay. Right after the Trump shooting, \n",
      "can you see Biden scrambling back to his feet, raising a defiant pit fist, shouting a battle cry to his supporters. This is not what Donald Trump did. He stayed down for 45 seconds, waited for the Secret Service to call all clear, spent about 15 seconds searching for his shoes. And then as they were about to pull him off stage, when he spen, he said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Photo up, and then did his thing. This is not like, this is such an inaccurate retelling of what happened. It's so cringe. Oh, my God. But everybody has thath, everybody has that impression. Suddenly they saw this image of him punching the air, blood all over his face, surviving an assassination attempt, and they thought, you know what? That's, as Mark Zuckerberg said, probably the first time in his life that was badass by Trump. How significant do you think the failed assassination attempt is going to be, particularly young people? Well, I think, look, I think that it helped Donald Trump tremendously. I think it's one of those things where it's like, like, I remember going to the opera with my wife, and I've never been to the opera before, but when you hear, like, an unbelievably talented singer at the opera, you're just like, whoa, that's incredible. It's almost an involuntary reaction. And there is something about seeing someone while there's bullets. Spran, they don't even know if they're hit yet and they're given the fist. Even if you despise Donald Trump, I think most people would admit, yeah, that was a good moment for him. He looked good there, I think, to the point that you guys were making before. Again, look, I'm a libertarian, and so I already know I'm gonna lose. So I kind of have an advantage on some of you guys. Like, I'm not married to either side here, but I think people blind themselves as he sucks off conservatives in the right over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again with narratives when they're all in on one camp. And to hear you guys, the \n",
      "guys, you literally just removed your candidate to go with another candidate after years of pretending that the emperor had closed while the rest of us were all talking about the guy who was clearly suffering through severe cognitive decline, finally, you guys had the emperor has clothes while talking about Donald Trump. A guy that's gone through like 20 fucking wives, fucked a porn star while cheating on his wife, and paid campaign money to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then lied about it to cover it up. Who tried to co the election was facing 80 some or whatever the fuck however many he federal or felony charges, who's already been convicted on 30 plus of those charges, who had three other fucking court cases. Like, yeah, yeah, the apparet closeause that on the. That's on the democratic side. Okay, dude. To admit Ited, who has to pick a new vice president, not the same one that he won the last election with. He had to pick a new vice president. Like, okay, dude. All talking about the guy who was clearly suffering through severe cognitive decline. Finally, you guys had to admit it. You pulled him out there. You're now going with a deeply unpopular vice presidential candidate. Look, good luck. But it's a big. The spin now is that it was just Joe Biden's age. That was the only issue that he slowed down. The truth is that if you look at every single poll, the two big issues here are the economy and immigration. I'm not a kid. I don't understand any of your black girl summer references. I don't know what brat means. Okay. I'm a dad in my forties. We've lived through, over the last couple of years, the worst price inflation in my life and the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime. This is a major problem. Kamala Harris is married to this administration, and Donald Trump's got a lot of red meat to run against. That's what this election is going to come down to. And it favors Trump. I agree. Chris, you respond to that. Let me a Chris respond, then I'll come to you. J. Yeah, I just want to say, as a Gen zer, I just disagree with this, this consistent notion that Kamala Harris is unpopular again. Yesterday we saw the largest fundraising day in american political history through actlue, grassroots dononers, five dollar tenllar, 20 fivelars. Gen Z is excited for a candidate, objectively, that's younger, a woman, and somebody who's been like a champion on things like climate and gun reform, etcetera. And I think that Gen Z specifically as a generation, me, myself, I've never seen America at peace. It's been nothing but chaos since I was born in 2002 president. And we're really at a boiling point. And what has caused this and what's caused this is Trump and the MAGA movement doing nothing but pushing division all the time with the lies and the disgusting, hateful retoric. And I think Gen Z is fired up to move on, to get cand. Oh, and he's laughing. He just s got a whiff of his own fart. He's been passing gas for the past 30 seconds. He just, and he just fel and he's about to come in was like Devis of rhetoric. Don't you mean, don't you mean when they called, when they called Trump Hitler over and over again? O that's what he's about to say. I can feel it. I can feel it. But actually care about us. I think one of the bigger issues, this painful rhetoric from the right to the left, and that definitely has been indisputable. But what about the hateful rhetoric from the left to the right? For example, for eight years hit, I've heard people on Pierce is going to do it, refer to Trump as the new Hitler. Thank as ADF, as if somehow he's presiding over a nazi style regime, which if you're too young to remember, perhaps, but the Nazis killed 12 million people. I don't know why he keeps springing out. You realize that was like at the end of the regime, right? Peier, that was at the end right, including murdering 6 million jews in a holocaust. So it's hard to imagine a more offensive or vile slur or more hateful rhetoric than to compare Donald Trump, who's done none of those things, to Adolf Hitler, did. Do you accept that people on the left have been just as guilty of hateful rhetoric, just as guiltyuting to the general, please, I walked. I walked so that you guys can run. Please don't admit. Please, not in front of these conservative cucks. Do not say that the left was just as bad as the right. Please do not do. Please don't do it. I need you guys to be strong and brave. I need you to be strong and brave. Please don't. Don't. Toxicity of the debate as people on the right, sure. But I do want to point out that, you know, the person who's actually called Donald Trump's America, it's Hitler. Is JD Vance, his current running mate. JD Vance was someone who is very staunchly her. I need her, and I need him. Please. You guys are my heroes. He's too young. He can't carry the torch. It's gotta be you two \n",
      "to calm the tensions. And look, I disagree with calling him America's Hitler. He's kind of saying he just shouldn't have said, sure, but if I call Donald Trump a dictator or a threat to democracy, I think it's almost dishonest to not call him that. This is somebody who tried to over election. He didn't evidence that he didn't win it. Yes. And so I don't understand how it's hateful the. That he's a threat democracy, always and again, the fact that JD Vance is the one who said things like, he's America's Hitler. Go to the fact that, you know, you have to give up all your morals and all your values and bow to Donald Trump in this party. Piers, me get a response to that from CJ. It appears that's absolutely insane. For Chris to sit here and say that it'dishonest for him not to call Donald Trump a dictator is absolutely laughable. Maybe if Chris actually visited a country with a real dictatorship, he would realize that under a system of governance where real dictators did't exist, the conversation, the debate, the discourse that we're having wouldn't even at all be possible. But that's all they traffick and is all this hyperbolic rhetoric that has actually no semblance of reality because they don't actually know how to defeat the president. Time and again during his presidency, we, the lowest, lack rate we, economic growth. We had a secure southern border. All of those things. Policy wins that. Bring it up. Can't raag it out. Do it. Exactly why Kamala Harris has to talk about a blackack girll summer. But here's a reality. Under Kamala Harris, you're gonna have a broke girl summer, a broke girl fall. \n",
      "100 more days to say that. God bless you. Your candidates winning. We'll see if Kamala Harris can catch him or not. Pierce, just a couple quick points to Dave Smith. I I'm a dad in my sixties. Look, look, I don't belong to either party. I'm not a Democrat. Dave and I probably agree on most policy issues. The difference is, I think Trump is a unique existential threat to our democracy. So I'll supportever the democratic. No. Is Pierce to you? You made a great point early. You said, we're living in unprecedented times. A month ago, an 81 year old candidate president had a debate and showed that he was not at all ready to continue to be a candidate. He was too old, and the entire democratic already rightfully panicked. It is a party process. It's not an election. The party convinced him to step aside, and he made that final decision. This is how the process in each party works. There's nothing undemocratic about it. Yeah. I just want to say that I think it is wrong to. To Hitler. Yeah. Fr. Ye. I agree. I think it's absolutely wrong. If you're gonna compare him to someone, is she're gonna say, like, mussolini or Stalin? I don't even know what she's. She's gonna pick some other kind of, like, it's obviously Mussolini. Okay. I do, right? I write for reality. If you're looking to hire somebody, okay, shoot me. An my rates are high, but much more of a showman. Great jawline. I think that's. That is where it happens. And look, Donald Trump has his own ad mission. Said he would be a dictator, but only on day one. So, guys, let's just listen to him. Take him at his word. Yeah. So be another problem. Francesca, listen, listen. Here's a problem. You know, funny, though, your quip just was, and maybe you mention or not, the truth is, I've just noticed that people on the left, when it comes to Donald Trump, they lose their collective minds. You know what, piers? You know what would be really nice is if you said that a single time ever, when confronting these convers. Funny as that quip might have been. Let's talk about the truth. Wouldn't that be interesting if people said that more often to conservatives or Donald Trump, mention or not the truth. Isa, listen, listen, here's a problem. You know, funny though, your quip just was and maybe you meant it or not. The truth is, I just noticed that people on the left, when it comes to Donald Trump, they lose their collective minds. The reality about the checks and balances of the american democratic process was they were actually very robust. You know, Trump may not have accepted the results of the 2020 election. To be clear, when you say the checks and balances were robust, kind of younn go if you wanna be real big into it. The reality is, is the checks and balances were, it was in part the bureaucracy and it was in part all of the individuals involved in that right. It was individuals that were rebuking Trump. It wasn't just like, oh, well, the policies and procedures as ke from doing it. It was the, it was your, well, no, \n",
      "people, people that h I wouldn't even be elected official, it wouldn't even be the bureaucy, it would literally just be the individuals that were involved that tried to stop trumpet every step of the way. Pence stopped Trump. The last ag bar, the deputy and the current ag, all the White House council, the stab, you know, people like the syiloney and the Hirschman'and, the, and his campaign, like, it was so many different people. It wasn't just the system. But he's not in the White House, he's not president of the United States. You know, he had to go that day. The checks and balances did work. I mean, we know you door Trump regularly appears. I'm surprised you don't have a white bandage on your, on your ear right now. Honestly. And we've seen and we've read f God, she's so based all 920 pages of Project 2025. And in it it says that instead of the police, the military should be patrolling time and again the presidented even though every single person who wrote it was a. Is that actually true? Project 2025, police, military? \n",
      "Is there like a link to the whole fucking document? Bullshit. \n",
      "She said 900 pages. So I'm assuming there's something \n",
      "this is going to take. Oh, it didnt take a long time. \n",
      "CT controll f police \n",
      "okay, I would have to read through this way more. I don't see it. Just in control. I police I don't see it, but it might be in here somewhere, but I'm not sure. \n",
      "Agenda 47, what does that mean? If I control f agenda 47? Is that like a thing? Oh, agenda. \n",
      "I don't see it any. \n",
      "The former Trump adviseor. Come on, give me break. Stepen Mil Trump himself has said that he does not support Project 2025. We're supposed to think that you believe more about what President Trump believes in what he has said himself. He believes's, you know, what's in his heart. You know what's in his heart. If you want to see what President Trump believes, go to Donald J. Trump. Who did that? What the fuck? You know what's in his heart? You know what's. If you want to see what President Trump believes, go to Donald Trump. Agenda 47. How about this? How about we don't go with what's in his heart and we go with the four year track record? I mean, you know, the problem here is that, and look to your point, obviously, the rhetoric on both sides has been elevated tremendously over the last few years. Very divisive times in both sides. Both sides. And both sides are guilty. Both sides or right to do it, however you look at it. But people do lose their collective minds when it comes to Donald Trump. Look, these comparisons, the idea that he's some hitlerian figure is ridiculous. Even the comparison to Musso. This is all silliness. Donald Trump was president for four years. Okay? He did a lot of things bad. I was a big critic of his foreign policy. His fiscal policy was very bad. I do not think he handled Covid well. But these are problems kind of similar to previous presidents before that. His rhetoric is much more bombastic than other presidents were. Okay? That's the reality that we're dealing. And the fact that you guys have to take this up to eleven. If there'some existential threat to the republic that isn't, by the way, you want to know the real existential threat to. Hold on 1 second, let me finish. The real existential threats to our republic right now is that debt, the interest on our debt is overtaking our entire budget. And this is something that Democrats and Republicans are both guilty. They don't want to talk about that because it condemns both of them. But the reality of the situation is that whatever happened on January 6 that got out of control. There certainly was violence there. Donald Trump got on a plane and went back to Mar a Lago. He was never calling in the military. There was never a chance that he was gonna institute that dictatorship in the United States of America. This is all election nonsense. And I'll tell you something, Democrats, you better figure out something else to run. \n",
      "The american people have rejected this already. No one cares about these charges that wouldn't have been brought to any other former president. Okay, this isn't gonna do it. You gotta have something of substance. You know, the problem is what you guys could actually run against is that Donald Trump was such a disaster through all of 2020, and he kept Fauci on the job and he kept Americans locked down. The problem is you guys were criticizing him for not locking down harder. So I don't know what angle you're gonna, wow. You could attack Trump by just being more conservative than the conservatives are. Why wouldn't the liberals be more conservative than the conservatives are to attack Trump? What a fucking politically retarded statement to make. The problem is you guys are worse on most of the issues. David, be better than that with saying, you guys, everybody opposes Donald Trump for their own reason. Quit saying you guys, and I'm sorry, quit saying we. Those of us who do believe, and you can disagree, Dave. Those of us who do believe Trump is a unique threat to democracy, quit saying we've lost our minds. Come on, man. Than you abutely. Hold on, CJ. Let me finish. CJ. I'm older than you, Dave, and CJ, in my lifetime, I've never seen a president and refuse to concede. I've never seen a president try to overthrow the results of that. What's Dave about to say? What is Dav, what is the dumb fuck comment? Dave. Dave is going to appeal. Dave is going to appeal to outcome. Dave's gonna say, well, what happened? He did leave, didn't he? Didn't he leave? It's not like they succeeded. He left, right? Didn't they? Didn't he eventually leave? Right. That's what he's gon toa say. An election. You can disagree with the severity. Let's be real specific. January r1 specific for. Or, oh, my God, you're right. Or he's gonna say, what about when Hillary called Trump illegitimate president? Wait, this is, I feel like not, are not willing to look into the deeper aspects. I mean, Donald Trump is someone who s had a whole fake electors, plot f electors to my state of Georgia and try to essentially take the will of the people away. He had the Department of Justice in the Oval Office demanding that they sign a letter, LetJ, that they believed there's election interference. And two DOJ officials resigned over that. Again, it is, is every single time. These are the talking points that need to come up every single fucking time. Every single time. Every single time. Every single time Donald Trump was normal. Or that people are losing their minds when they say he's a threat to democracy. I mean, he tried and went through every single illegal and legal action to over election. And why people are freaked out is because if you have another Trump presidency where he could install loyalist, all of a sudden those checks and are going to say yes. Yeah. And one of the reasons Vance JD vans literally said, oh, if you would'tried j six with me, I would have come through for him as a vice president. Yes, exactly. Me, valid institution. Dave, Dav and CJ, let me ask, let me just make ll Dav, I'll shut up for good. One more point. It's now Kamala Harris, Donald Trump. It's Kamala Harris against Donald Trump. If Kamala Harris loses in November, Kamala Harris will concede and she'll accept the will of the people. If Donald Trump loses in November, he won't and he won't. That is a threat. I just want to \n",
      "respond. Let Dave respond. Then I'll come to C. J. So if I were to say right now I wanna overthrow democracy in the United States of America, wouldn't I actually send the National Guard? Wouldn't I bring guns there? If I really wanted to overthrow the government and I picked a way that was kind of dumb, or g, that would be dumb, right? Wouldn't I have done it a different way? Wouldn't it be a different thing I could have done? Actually, that's what it's gonna be. That's what he's about to say. When I told the people to show, when I have called the military an institute of dictatorship, I don't think anyone on the panel is very freaked out by that because I have no power to do it. Like, it doesn't really matter if I want to do it or not. Now I will kind of agree with you guys. I just, wait, I don't even know what he said. Nevermind. He didn't say. I don't even know what the fuck. He's honest. Oh, he might not be familiar with literally anything that happened, too. I always forget. Dav Smith is very good at sounding like an intelligent person because he does memorize more like factoids than I've ever seen a person ever before. But on the whole, he either intentionally misunderstand, like entire context or narratives, or he's just too stupid or doesn't put really, he doesn't give a fuck. So he's just like a partisan hack, right? So he'll know the talking points, but he doesn't actually try to have any as he's talking about, which is why you get an unfathomably embarrassing debate between him and Andrew Wilson, where he doesn't know what the non aggression principle is. Holy fuck. Noen on let me just respond to. Let Dave respond, then I'll come to seej. So if I were to say right now I want to overthrow democracy in the United States of America and institute a dictatorship, I don't think anyone on the panel is very freaked out by that because I have no power to do it. Like, it doesn't really matter if I want to do it or not. Now I will kind of agree with you guys. I just thought the way Trump handled the 2020 election was terrible. I did think he was kind of using bully tactics when he called the secretary. But the bottom line is that he had no mechanism to actually overthrow democracy. And that was total. They literally had multiple mechanisms. He just doesn't know. Is somebody here gonna educate him? Please? What did he mean when he said Pence needs to do the right thing? What was he talking about there? Please, please, please, somebody attempt to it. Hold on, hold on. Let me just finishus I let you guys go for a second. Let me just finish making my point here. This is the problem with you guys going to this well over and over again. It was never actually a threat to overthrow democracy. If you want to talk about people who haven't accepted the results of elections, oh, then, oh, Al Gora. Hillary Clinton or Hillary Clinton staceacy Russia. Just say Russiagate. Say Russia gate. Please say Russia gate. I'm edging, I'm edgingg. I'm so close to coming. I don't know. He's gonna say it's like 50 50. Please say Russia gate. So please, please, please. I'm edging so much.

      "I'd now like to ask some questions about so called alternate electors, and I just want to make sure we all have sort of the same understanding of what that means. And if you use a different term, please let me know. So when I'm going to refer to alternative lectors, these are going to be in states where the state authority declared that Joe Biden was the winner in that state, but the Trump electors nonetheless met and signed certifications that they were electors. So do you understand what I mean by alternate electors? Yeah, my understanding of them was whereas contingent electors in case any legal challenges changed the result of any state, so then they would have met as a necessary step in case to meet the requirement by the Supreme Court, but they were contingent in case legal challenges changed something in any particular state. So when was the first time you recall learning about the concept that these alternate electors were going to meet and cast electoral votes? So to the best of my recollection, the first, I don't know the exact date. My memory is that it was after kind of the White House Christmas season in prior December 14. So maybe within a few days before December 14 that I received a call for the RNC to help bring the electors together for this contingent purpose based on potential legal challenges that hadn't been finished yet. Question and I know it's hard to recall specific dates from something that happened a long time ago, but the Supreme Court rejected the petition in Texas v. Pennsylvania on December 11 of 2020. Do you recall whether the call you received was before or after the Supreme Court's action? I don't recall. I really don't recall when it would be. It would have come through the White House switchboard. So my gut would be that it was before that. \n",
      "Okay. But do you recall there being any express conversation about whether or not there would still be a case pending? There was still a case pending with the spri court at the time. My understanding is that there was that case, but there were other cases. Well, so there were many cases going on. Okay, and who was the call from? When I received the call, again, I don't remember the exact date. It was from the White House switchboard, and it was President Trump who had contacted me. And did President Trump have anyone else on the line with him? He introduced me to a gentleman named John Eastman. And was it just the three of you on the call, meaning President Trump, John Eastman, and you? I dont know. Okay. As far as you know, though, were you the only three as far as I know, those are the only people who spoke, who I spoke on the call. O whether or not, I don't know if he was patched in those things, I don't know. I understand. And I'll just note for the record, the representative Zoe Lofgren has joined us. Answer, okay. Question so what did the president say when he called you? Aner so to the best, my recollection, and again, is a long time ago, he introduced me to John Eastman. I was not familiar with him at the time, so I vaguely remember him mentioning that he was a professor. And then essentially he turned the call over to Mister Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC helping the campaign gather these contingent electors. Case of the, of the, any legal, any of the legal challenges that were ongoing changed the result in any of the states, and so they would fulfill the requirement for the electors if it went to the Supreme Court.

      "Do you remember President Trump saying anything other than introducing John Eastman? I don't remember that. I remember he may have said, don remember. I remember the John Eastman portion. And that's the thing I remember the most about the call and to Professor Eastman when he was proposing that the RNC tried to have these so called electors or Trump electors meet, did he expressly referred to the possibility that there could be an outcome in one of those cases that would make them necessary? Yeah, that was an, my understanding. I took it as there was pending litigation that could change chec from of state. So please help these contingent electors meet in case something happened where the outcome of the state election changed based on these legal actions. And did Professor Eastman give any other reason why elections might be necessary? Not that I recall. Did need to make any reference to the possibility of state legislatures adopting these electors? Not that I recall. And did Eastman say anything about those electors potentially being useful at a joint session of Congress? Not that I recall. Then similarulated to Eastman say anything about the alternate electors writing a possible basis for the vice president rejected by an electors? Not that I recall. What was your reaction? It was twofold. First, I called the campaign because that's typically rol of the campaign to gather the electors because they are actually representing the candidate. So I called Justin Clark, who was from the campaign. He'also counsel. I don't know if that's privilege, but my impression from the conversation was that they were already aware of it and they were working on it. And then I subsequently hung up the phone, and I believe this is, again, a long time ago. This is my memory. It may not be exact, but I believe I called back the White House to say that the campaign was working on this already and let President Trump know. And at the time, I believe I only spoke to him and it was a quick call. But you spoke directly with the president as far as you know, nobody else is on the call. It's my recollection. I don't remember Eastman on that call. \n",

On December 13 and 14th, President Trump worked with Rudolph Giuliani on the plans of implementation. On the 13th, Miller texted some of his colleagues to check in about the fake elector meeting scheduled for the following day. He let them know that Giuliani had told him POTUS was aware and they would be filling or filing litigation in four states just to keep the effort going, which the select committee believes was to create a pretext to claim that it was still possible for the fake electors to be authorized retroactively. In subsequent litigation, a federal district court found that President Trump filed certain lawsuits not to obtain legal relief, but to disrupt or delay the January 6 congressional proceedings through the courts.

Emails related to and inf of the conspiracy to defraud four emails demonstrate an effort by President Trump and his attorneys to press false claims in federal court for the purpose of delaying the January 6 vote. The evidence confirms that this effort was undertaken in at least one lawsuit filed in Georgia. On December 4, 2020. President Trumpet his attorneys alleged in a Georgia state court action that Fulton county improperly counted a number of votes, including 10,315 deceased people, 2560 felons, and 2000 423 unregistered voters. President Trump and his attorneys then decided to contest the state court proceedings in federal court and discussed incorporating by reference the voter fraud numbers alleged in the state petition. On December 30, 2020, Doctor Eastman related concerns from President Trump's team about including specific numbers in the paragraph dealing with Felon's deceased moved, etcetera. The attorneys continue to discuss the president's resistance to signing when specific numbers were included, as Doctor Eastman explained the next day. Although the president signed a veri for the state court filing back on December 1, he has since been made aware that some of the allegations and evidence proffered by the experts has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge and incorporation by reference would not be accurate. Hmm. Okay. \n",

      "another, but okay, I feel like he knows philosophy better than that, but most people is the liberal streamer Destiny in today's episode, I want to talk about how Destinys'commitment to consistency reveals the fatal flaws and the positions he defends. So let's start with the statements he made last week on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. On X, Destiny wrote, having a firearm means absolutely nothing if you don't spend time at the range practicing with it, implying that he wished the shooter had not missed Trump, which is a gross thing. A scary number of Trump critics were saying. But then Destiny doubled down on it by saying he wasn't bothered by another innocent person at the rally who was shot, namely Corey comparatorian, ex fire chief, husband and father, Destiny writes, a person in a crowd cheering for and supporting a traitor to this country caught as stray bullet. I'm so sad. Please. And he made other posts mocking the man. In fact, here's a very interesting post. One user writes, you can't say Trump is Hitler one day, then wish him well the next day. That's not how it works. Unless you're a lying, corrupt pos to which Destiny responds, agree with this, be morally consistent, and don't wish him well. And that's des's biggest problem, when common sense bas tells us, holy shit, I shouldn't say or do this. Like mocking a shooting victim at a rally. Destiny is comfortable not listening to what our basic human decency would tell us. Rather, he lets the consistency of his worldview carry him out to extreme ends. Part of this, though, may be rage baiting for attention, or it's the brain rot that comes from spending the majority of your waking life on the Internet as a streamer. But the desire to be consistent above all else concerns me, and I want to talk about in this episode. So in this case, there are a lot of people who compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. The new Republic even depicted Trump as Hitler in their June 2024 issue, saying, he's damn close enough to fascism and we'd better fight. Trump was shot six days after this post, but destiny would say, if it's okay to celebrate the assassination of old Hitler, why wouldn't it be okay to celebrate the assassination new Hitler? Even if that act involved casualties among civilians who celebrated new Hitler. It the dude, the firefighter guy Trump people that support him. \n",
      "Most people misunderstand this quote. Wait, what? Most of us are familiar with this phrase from Ralph Waldo Emerson. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little mindes. It is often misquoted as simply, consistency is the hobgob of little minds, or even more sloppy approximations like conformity is a bugbear of small minded people, etcetera. Here's the quotation, in longer form, with more of its original context, it becomes immediately apparent that it has nothing to do with writing style and everything to do with inflexible mentality. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines with consistency. A great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow. Speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words. Again, though it contradict everything you said today. Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood. Is it so bad then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood. And Socrates and Jesus and Luther and Copernicus and Galileo and Newton and every peer and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. \n",

If one of you were in the crowd, whoa, conservative fan of mine, you end up, you know, getting Wacy and wild, making fun to be the next day on Twitter, I am 100% first, I hate comparisons to Hitler. They don't make the person more evil, they just make Hitler less evil. If everybody's Hitler, then Hitler must not have been that bad of a person. True. Second, this criticism goes beyond destiny. I see a lot of people who dig their heels in and hold repugnant views because they feel that as long as they're consistent, then they aren't wrong, and other people even respect them simply because they're willing to be consistent and stick to their guns. For example, I once attended a private lecture with the philosopher Peter Singer and a bunch of his fans at Arizona State university. Peter Singer writes in one article, we cannot coherently hold that it is all right to kill a fetus a week before birth, but as soon as the baby is born, everything must be done to keep it alive. The solution, however, is not to accept the view that the fetus is a human being with the same moral status as yours or mine. The solution is the very opposite, to abandon the idea that all human life is of equal worth. So Peter Singer defends infanticide, but he's also an animal rights activist. So I asked him in that lecture if it was okay for my parents that they euthanized their incontinent dog. Singer said it was permissible if the dog was a significant burden. I then asked him if it would have been fine to euthanize my hypothetical, mildly disabled newborn brother if he was just as much an inconvenience. Singer hemmed and he hwed, but eventually he admitted it would not be wrong to kill my hypothetical baby brother. Based \n",

And he'd be like, hey, listen, I'm gonna give you $45 million worth of advertising a month for free, and I'm just gonna write it off. That is exactly what he wasnna do, but now he's not doing it.

I have no idea. Do you think he can do that? Like, what are the limits of Elon? I mean, arguably, didn't he kind of fuck himself with Twitter on that a little bit? What do you mean? Like, isn't that kind of what happened with Twitter? He's like, yeah, I think I'm gonna buy this. And he's like, e, I don't think I'm gonna buy this. And the SeCCC was like, no, now you have to buy that. Oh, oh, no, no. I'm saying, like, right now. Couldn't Elon literally. Okay, so here's the deal. So I. Because it's insanely fucking cheap, because there's everyone left. It's, like, wide open. It's super cheap to advertise there and get conversions. I don't know, it's like nobody wants to do it. You're not competing against Coca Cola or anything else anymore. I don't understand why they have all this unsold inventory. They should literally just fucking promote the fuck out of Trump's campaign and say, hey, we're donating this ad inventory to you. There you go. And like, there you go.

Well, he would have to start dumping stock then, if he wanted to cash out. Right. Because if the subsidy goes away completely or something, I imagine it would have a significant impact on. Especially because newer electronic vehicles entering the market would get that subsidy. Right? Well, yeah, I think he's saying get rid of it completely, right?

And literally anything's possible. Does Twitter matter for elections? That's a real question. I think it's. I feel like Twitter is still one of the most important news platforms for social media.

And, like, the people on Twitter are already set on who they're gonna vote for, and it's not really swaying one way or the other. It's just a battlefield of the far right and the far left. And all the other normies, they're like the tabors out there just talking about sports and shit. Or is that like a stupid take? I have no idea. I don't know. It's hard to say. I know that, like the majority of Americans get their news from social media now, but I don't know what kind of social media. I'm not sure. I'm sure there's got toa be like polullling on that.

So the hypothesis is that all of those who, in a mindset to be exploring alternative explanations for events that we are currently witnessing in real time, were lured into exploring the evidence here, which had been arrayed in a way that the dots would inevitably be connected, and then President Biden could emerge and it would embarrass all of the people who had specul about his \n",

Do he know? That's my making this up. \n",
      "That was from Hutchinson. \n",

So I poked my head out of the office and I saw the ballet walking towards our office. He had said, get the chief down to the dining room. The president wants him. So Mark went down to the dining room and came back to the office. A few minutes later, after Mark had returned, I left the office and went down to the dining room, and I noticed the door was propped open and the valet was inside the dining room changing the tablecloth off of the dining room table. He motioned for me to come in and then pointed towards the front of the room near the fireplace mantele in the tv, where I first noticed there was catchup dripping down the wall, and there's a shattered porcelain plate on the floor.

He's really, really ticked off about this right now. Fucking thing sucks. And, Miss Hutchinson, was this the only instance that you are aware of where the president. Through dishes. It's not. And are there other instances in the dining room that you recall where he expressed his anger? There were. There were several times throughout my tenure, chief of staff, that I was aware of him either throwing dishes or flipping the tablecloth to let all the contents at the table go onto the floor and likely break or go everywhere.

And in order to pass off his responsibilities, let them know that Rudy's team is designated Kenneth Cheesebrough, or Ches, as the point person for the legal documents going forward. While the campaign's Cor legal team stepped back from the fake elector effort on December 11, it nonetheless went forward because Rudy was in charge of it, and this is what he wanted to do. According to Finlay, when Finlay was asked if this decision to let the effort proceed under Giuliani's direction was coming from your client, the president. Finlay responded, yes, I believe so. I mean, he had made it clear that Rudy was in charge of this and that Rudy was executing what he wanted. Finlay El also recalled being told that Chessspboro's elector memo had become the justification for why Rudy and Ken were re going to keep going forward with this stuff. He explained that Giuliani really bought into Ken's theory on this and that the two of them were kind of the main ones driving this from that point forward. Clark told us likeect committee that my understanding of who was driving the process was Mayor Gliani and his team.

And if you aren't aware, after the Trump nation attempt, in which I think someone else in the crowd ended up passing away from the bullet that Miss Trump, a lot of people had a lot of things to say. A lot of people were talking about it. We were on vacation, so I didn't really give. And also, I'm not american, so not my country, not my problem. Destiny made some comments, essentially \n",
      "laughing, didn't really care if I could summarize everything in a very gleeful tone. He was saying, fck around and find out, which I hope is a pretty fair summation of what he was e chly trying to say. He says, if you're somebody who engages in violet rhetoric, as Trump does, according to him. And if you're one of his supporters who support somebody who's an insurrectionist who wanted to overthrow their government, suspend the constitution, yada, yada, yada, I don't really care if bad things happen to you because you're the kind of person who encourages people to violence. That was aistake. And he s like, I don't care. And he said so by making jokes. And a lot of people had a problem with it. They felt it was insensitive, it was disgusting. Et eta, is that a fair summation? Yeah. All right. I saw some people saying he endorses assassination attempts, or he's saying people should. It's not what he said. From everything I've seen, and I'll probably post a clips of him talking about it. He hasn't said that. Get the dude, the firefighter guy. Trump, I just want you to know, okay, just in case you're confused or it seems like I'm, you don't, whatever, if one of you were in the crowd and you're a conservative fan of mine, and you end up, you know, getting blown away or whatever the fuck, I'm making fun of you the next day on Twitter, I am 100% a person in a crowd cheering for and supporting a traitor to this country caught astray. I'm so sad. Please. As well as Donald Trump incited it, an insurrection, and then was granted full criminal immunity for possibly all of his involvement. I have zero sympathy for anything that happens to him or anyone who supports him. If I've offended anyone with my recent tweets, I'd like to make things right. Dm me and I'll buy you front row seats to the next Trump. Rolly, there is this moment where Pierce Morgan says, you seem almost gleeful, than saying that makes you, frankly, despicable. With destiny responding, I don't think I'm gleeful about anything. I don't think anybody should die. I don't think anybody deserves to die, which you can still say is incredibly bad. But I just want to be accurate as possible. So listen, I'll say this, man. You know, sometimes y'all dm me or leave me comments. You're like, oh, you afraid to talk about your girl? I don't give off. First off, fuck you and fuck anybody who think I got a problem with saying this shit. I ain't afraid of saying none of this stuff. And I think a lot of you and the fanbe have gotten very comfortable because you've seen that for a long time. We've covered trans women in sports or all this other stuff. So you think like we perfectly aligned with some of you on the far right where you guys are like, I don't believe it. None of this, I'm not with you. I have no problem saying it and bothers you and you need to take, take a hike, okay? Just because I made fun of fucking dweebby liberals who go and want to have safe spaces and do all this corny shit, it does not mean I'm a right winger who thinks all libs are bad, okay? That's you. Now, we don't align there. If you can handle that, stick around. If you can't, that's in my business. But don't ever think that I'm afraid to expouse what I'm thinking just to keep you around. I don't care. I'm gonna say my thoughts. Whether you leave or not, whether we go down a million subs or not, I don't care. And as far as what destiny goes, I'm not bothered by at all. Why? Because the way he talks is normal for american political landscape, okay? I have seen it dege generate over the last ten years, especially since Trump joined, where people say all kinds of stuff, including Trump himself. I've watched Trump say he wanted to punch protesters in the face and he walking out and we're not allowed, you know, the guards are very gentle with him. He's walking out like big high fives, smiling, laughing like the punch him in the face, I'll tell you. \n",
      "And we'll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi who ruins San francisco. \n",

      "Tired you guys. The last gu that came here, you did the same thing. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. The last night did the same thing. You in the guardian? Yes. And you just broke my, you, last guy did the same damn thing. You just body slammed me and broke my glasses. Destiny and others have essentially said as being a hypocrite in this situation. Tweeting out a screenshot of Rubin meming about hammer time after what happened to paul Pelosi. Also linking to when Rubin wrote, here's hoping that AOC, rashida and ilhan join aaron Bushnel in his brave protests. If you don't remember, is the service member who lit himself on fire to protest what was happening in gaza. I've seen oh, shit. I didn't know DeFranco had caught all my tweets. Damn. All kinds of politicians from Dan Crenshaw talking about punching antifa people in the face and talk about violence all the time. It has become normalized in a first world country like America to engage in politics like a third world country. That's how y'all talk about violence and shit in your country. And it's not just themps. I've seen republicans do it. And so do I really care that someone else made a fuck around? I don't care. This is your playground. This is the sandbox that y'all condemn all this behavior. You guys go ahead. But as an outsider, I'm just seeing more of the same. The thing that happened is that you go on platforms and you call people from the the left snowflakes because they're acting a certain way. Now look at you. You're doing the same thing. You guys are doing the same thing. Y. Like a snowflake is not someone on the left. A snowflake is just someone that just can't handle being talked about. Yep. That's a snowflake. And you could be snow people on the right. Y'all can be snowflakes, too. Yep. Because the way. Believe he. That's what they doing over there. Absolutely. And then you do that over there, too. It's just you're the same people. You just. You have the same mo. The same motus up or Andy. And you have the same way of working as them. You just have different broad ways of thinking, but it'the same way. How many times during the BLM protests were people talking about mowing them down or running them over, doing all kinds of violence? That was normal. That was normal. That's you guys talking about your fellow citizens and talking about how you guys want violence against them. And that was normal in the right circles. So don't sit here now and then act like somebody who doesn't care about the fact that a right wing or die is some big surprise to you. You know, that, to me, is a little bit pathetic. That's Elon mus pathetic all talking about, oh, I want to run a free speech platform. You're platforming everything under the sun from neo to. Doesn't matter who it is, okay? You can even have the ayatollah. They can spew whatever they want, anti gay, anti black, whatever. Destiny makes that joke. And then you want a pearl clutch, bro? Get him out of here. Get him out of here. This is the biggest amount of pearl clutching I ever seen, for most of these people in the hypocrisy is crazy. Now, if you want to say you're not okay with what Destiny said, I got a problem with that. You'fine to say. You can say it's bad behavior because at the end of the day, it's bad from everybody. Destiny just engage you more of the bad. But do I actually care that all the people, all the pigs look like pigs? No. And I know this video is going to be unpopular with a lot of you. I also don't care. Don't ever think that I'm afraid to say what I'm going to say because it makes some of y'all upset or make, I don't give a shit. Is he my friend? Sure. And my biaseus bit, probably. But honestly, when I sit back and think about it, and even when I talk about it with my people, none of them really disagreed that heavily. So that's how I feel about it. And all this talk about, oh, you guys are afraid to talk about the tr. I don't give a shit. I'm not a. That's your problem. That's your country, right? I generally don't talk about presidential elections in other countries. It's not my place. You wanted it, you got it. Now you're unhappy with it. Doors right there. You can't talk about freedom of speech. Freedom of speech. But then when it, it's not aligned with what you're thinking, you came. You can't say stuff like that. You're. That's not, that's not what freedom of speech means, bro. Freedom of speech actually means that the person that disagrees with you have the right to say it. Yeah, they have the right to say it. Depending what they say, there'consequences. But they have the right to say it. Go ahead, say it. Say it out loud. What your chance, it might, it might not be aligned with what I think, bro. That's what freedom of speech is. So the minute you don't, you have this guy that does not agree with you and says something that you said in the back, it's still freedom of speech. You want it. Well, they want it too, bro. And that's how it works. What are your thoughts? Thoughts are. That's pretty. You can disagree with what someone, and the politics of someone, it's always going toa be wild when you're gonna be like, oh, yeah, if they die, people are gonna have a problem with that. That's, that's for sure. For sure. You can disagree with the politics of some person and be like at this school, the politics. But in wishing death upon the person if death happens, like man, people are definitely gonna ##n I takenn have a problem with it. I think what he would say was a bit wild, but did he have the right to say, I believe that he did have the right to say what I think was messed up thing. The weird thing was him getting banned off all the social media and stuff like that. To be clear, he was banned off of kik and demonetized, which is like a degenerate platform for pedos and all kinds of ca it like they allow everything on that platform that you could imagine terms of degeneracy. I thought that it was weird that this was where they drew the line, but they did reinstatement. And I think he was demonetized on Twitter by Elon Musk, free speech champion. Yeah, the guy that says o I'mnna buy this platform and I'm going to allow all the free speech. But then you got that one person that does not agree what you're saying and, and you're doing this exact same thing. You, you're became the he the enemy. Right. Side note, there's this comedy night here, mutal in French that basically it's GhB Gore hardcore. And I remember what the b says for. But basically you go on there and you do comedy and you push your jokes to the limit and it's made for that. Al right. You go there and you say wild stuff in the comedy setting, right? Uh, joke that you're never going to do again and everything and stuff. And I was on the stage of that thing and I didn't remember I was talk the whole night. There was some other people that went on stage, made jokes about PDF files jokes and all those great jokes and stuff like that. I go on stage, I do a couple of jokes, then I do some jokes on gay people, right? And one of them in the crowd, there was a break, there was like an intermission the in the show and I saw one of the guys outside, I was at the show and he was like, oh no. Yeah, thation me. I can't like really what he said was no, really, I was not having it cuz. Oh, the PDF jokes was all right. The great jokes was cool. But when, when, when what is when it was you, you, you say, nah, you was like, nah, I'm not having it. You're a big hypocrite. You're a big hypocrite. I understand that comedy is just like a drunk on call at Christmas, it's funny until he touches you, but at the end of the day, you're a big hypocrite. You're a big u jYp. And that's what it is. That my problem with that is that he's going to be on all those platform, like you say, the kick platform, which ob seen you show. I'm not on the platform know, I show everything you show me. And this is what, and this is where you draw the line. Okay? You draw the line at f around and find out. But you got people kissing teenagers, grown ass, man giving teenagers. And you're cool with that? You want to laugh. All the political commentators always talk about how the left is about del platforming, all this stuff. How many of them did I see go online and complain to Elon, talk about this? This is hate speech. This is inciting, blah, blah, blah. You realize that they're quick to deatform just as much as the lefties. They'll talk about it and they'll laugh at liberals, be like, oh, the platform is so bad. But the moment that they'like, this happened, they also yell for it. So I, the same people, I might have spoken about liberals a lot because that's who I spend most of my time with. But over time and spending enough time around these folks, you just realize that they engage in the exact same stuff. They docs, they, they deplatform, they encour all this kind of stuff from the biggest political commentators to the smallest one. So I didn, that they left and right, y'all the same people. It really feel like it's just because you think whenever you, whenever you pause an action, you do an action, you just think it's righteous because it aligns with what you think. Yep. Whether it's left or right, y'all, y'all, y'all the same. Yeah, you're the same. Be where? But I did it because I did, to protect, well, they did the same thing. They're doing the same thing as well. To protect or to whatever or to go aign or to erase what is wrong, what they believe is wrong. Y'all the same. And everything we said is factual. You guys can go look this up. You can go look up the facts that a bunch of republicans have been calling for violence for a long time. You go look up the fact that a bunch of people on the right, big commentators, have been calling for deeplambing for a long time. So knowing that, I don't know how you guys are getting to even argue, but guess what? At the end of the day, much like Ben Shapiro, loves to say what fact don't care about your feelings. And I have a feeling that most of the people who react to the situation had a very emotional response. That's what it is. I'm detached from all this. You guys are quick to say facts don't care about your feelings. But they feel when the fact. When the fact aligns with your feelings. And then you say facts don't care about your feelings k because you don't care about that fact. But when you donn t care about that fact, you. That's you. I think the only unfor ##un to think about this whole video is that it might have been out of focus. Really? Watch this anyway so who cares? Yeah, you can listen to it. Yeah yeeah it's out of focus. But I'm not re recording this. Sh is the audio fire audio. He blame the whole shit. That's itways. Let's know what you guys think in the comments below. Yo, I predict this video gonna have a \n",

      "I don't even remember this. Pushed a version of Eastman's theory in the courts. On December 27, Gomert and several for the suit of Arizona filed suit against Vice President Pence in the us district court. As Ward explained the mark short on a phone call the daily suit was filed president terms aware of the lawsuit to sign off on it. Wouldn't have done that without the president telling us was okay, she told him. The suit the plainiff alleged they were competing slates of electors from five states. They asked the court to rule that portions of the electoral count of 1887 were unconstitutional and that the 12th amendment contains the exclusive dispute resolution mechanisms for determining an objection raised by a member of Congress to the elector submitted by the state. \n",
      "Oh, the that case was immediately dismissed. Okay. \n",
      "Okay, Vice president \n",
      "okay. January 2, Pence met with Hissel, Greg Jacob, chief of staff Mark Short and Matt Morgan to discuss the joint session. Morgan was the Trump campaigns general counsel and previously served Assel the vice president Pence. At this point, the vice president already had a clearner understanding what his road be in the electoral count. Vice president defense was concerned that most people did not understand how the certification electoral vots worked. So jig began drafting a statement for the vice president issue in January 6. The statement is intended to provide a civic education on the joint session, explaining to the american people his actions, including why the vice president didn't have the authorities that others had suggested that he might. \n",
      "The men discussed the various points of pressure being applied to the vice president, including Eastmans theories, the Gomert suit Ellis arguments as well as how the electoral count process should work. They also discussed allegations of irregularities and Malad administration of the election, concluding that none of the allegations raised were sufficient to reverse President Trumps defeat. While Vice President Pence recognized Congress'authority under the Electoral Count act to raise objections to the certification, neither he nor his staff wereare of any evidence of fraud that would have had a material effect on the outcome of the election in any state. Because of President Trumps repetition of election fraud allegations, Jacob and the vice president staff conducted their own evaluation of those claims. Jacob asked Morgan to send the campaigns best evidence of election fraud, maladministration, irregularities and abuses in the system. The vice president'legal staff memorialized the review they conducted of these materials in a memo to Vice President Pence, which concluded most allegations to sustain a voter fraud, defined to mean the casting of legal ballots in violation of prevailing election laws, are either relatively small in number or cannot be verified. Pence also discussed the Trump campaign s fag electors with his advisors. Both Jacob and Morgan assured Pence that there were not dual sl of electors. The electors organized by the Trump campaign were not valid. Morgan had already written a memo on the topic in December, concluding that the alternate electors that is fake locase certificate of ascertainment issued by the state. Without such an ascertainment, the Trump campaign's fake electors had no standing during the joint session. Jacob had also prepared a flowchart memo outlining each of the legal provisions implicated in the joint session. On January 6, Jacob advised Pence that none of the slates that had been sent in would qualify as an alternate slate within the meaning of the Electoral Count Act. Pence was still worried about the fake elector issue, that it was soing confusion, so he wanted his statement on January 6 be transparent as possible. \n",

The VP hardwired into the Constitution and somehow the vice president of United States and President Trump's Department of Justice argued against that. So walk us through where we stand.

Brain trust of the MAGA movement. So here's where we stand. Last night in an interesting decision, a federal district court did rule against the Louis Gor lawsuit, but only on standing. Only on standing, not on the merits. Again, using that standing doctrine, the same that the Supreme Court used against the Texas lawsuit to p on the \n",
      "issue, this time on the fucking rumble. \n",
      "Just as a real quick thing, people will say that standing doesn't matter. They'll say, oh, well, that was kicked out on standing. Fuck you. There are times when that's a legitimate argument. For instance, if somebody were to say, oh, this particular thing is definitely wrong. And then somebody goes, what do you mean that's wrong? And then somebody says, well, the court ruled that on the merits. The court ruled that this thing is wrong. And then somebody says, if in that case, you look at the court case like, well, actually they tossed this on standing because they said that these parties, you know, didn't have standing to bring a case in front of a judge, that would be a good time to say, well, the standing isn't relevant, but in other times, standing is the merits in a way. Right? So, like for the Texasipp B Pennsylvania case, tossed on standing. The idea there isn't so much to say that Pennsylvania, you ran their election, exceptly or not. It's more to say that one state doesn't have a say in how another state runs their election. You have no standing there. That's a really important concept. Standing is not just some irrelevant bullshit that it was standing, so it didn't actually matter. No standing is important. You have to prove. Proving that you're an injured party, depending upon the type of suit, can be the most important part of a particular suit. You know, Texas proving that they have an injury that they've suffered because about Pennsylvania runs their election, it incorporates a whole bunch of, like, constitutional and state law theory and a whole bunch of stuff like that's, like, that's arguably the most merit thing that you're kind of, like, looking at in that particular case. You know, how does standing def differ from jurisdiction? I believe that a jurisdiction just refers to a particular forum that has the authority or right to hear a case. I think jurisdiction refers to the court, the venue, the court that's hearing a case. And standing refers to the parties that could have a suit brought before a court. So, for instance, the court of the state of Pennsylvania wouldn't have the jurisdiction to hear a crime that was committed in the state of Florida. But that you're talking about the jurisdiction is what the court can hear. And then standing is gonna be the parties that are hurt by a thing have to prove that they were hurt by a thing, and that the court can provide relief for that thing. So that gives you standing, and that there's not like another blocker there that gu. You're standing to bring a case. So parties have to have standing, and then they bring that standing to a court that has jurisdiction here case, and then you suck everybody's dick or whatever, \n",
      "which is actually pretty clear. The wide, expansive, large amount of power that the vice president has in terms of counting the votes under the 12th amendment of the Constitution, irrespective of what the electoral count act says. So here's where we stand. In Georgia, a filing has been made in district court. So I haven't. \n",
      "We've kind of brought this up before, but now I have a better legal understanding of everything. I think I can kind of understand more what they're doing here. So we have a thing called the 12th Amendment. Okay. For the 12th amendment, the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for president and vice president, one of whom, at least, shall not be inhabitant of the same state with themselves. They shall name in their ballots the person voted for as president, and a distinct ballots. The person vote for his vice president and they shall of all persons voted for as president, and of all persons voted for as vice president, and of the number of votes for each which list they shall sign and certify on, transmit sealed to. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Direct to the president of the Senate, the president of the Senate. So this is. The vice president shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes for president shall be the president. If such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed, and if no such person has a majority, then from the person having the highest under law. But in choosing the president, the votes should be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote. Let's see. \n",
      "Okay. But in choosing the president, the vote shall be taken by states, the representation of each state having one vote. A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states in majority of all the states should be necessary for choice. If the House representer shall not the person have the greatest number of votes as vice president should be the vice president of such number. The. A majority of the whole number of electors appointed. And if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the senate shall choose the vice president. A quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice, but no person constitutionally ineligible to the office. Up. President. Okay. Okay. One thing they invoke is the 12th amendment. And then a second thing that they invoke is they try to say that the. \n",
      "Let's see. \n",
      "There's a law called the electoral Count act. \n",
      "Fuck. I'm not gonna able to find this. Fuck. I wish I could point to this directly. I don't think anybody will get into this much into the weeds on the argument. But what it sounds like they were trying to do is they were trying to say, the Electoral Count act lays out the procedures that Congress ought to follow in order to resolve disputes if people are disagreeing about the slates of electors. But what Chesboro was trying to argue and then what Eastman ended up amplifying was, well, actually, we think that the electoral candate is actually un constitution bet. We think that it's unconstitutional because the Electoral Count act dictates the way that Congress should act or that the Senate should act in rules that are not in accordance with ordinary Senate rules. And so what they were saying is Pence should step up and say, I'm going to do this constitutionally. Meaning he's gonna ignore how the electoral count act says that you ought to conduct yourself, and then he can either recuse himself and have the another president of the Senate come up and do it, which was part of. He could just say that when there's a dispute between, like, alternate Sl of electors, he can say, well, ordinarily the vice president or the president of the Senate has the ability to end debate and then toss it back to the House delegation. But it was some theory like this, if somebody wants to get to the w, I guess, well, we can read the ECA, and I doubt anybody will get that deep, but they were basically hinging on the electoral count act, basically being able to say, we think that's unconstitutional, so we're going to act in a different way. And either people \n",
      "or they won't challenge because it'll be mayhem, and then they can just try to get the vote certified for Trump. That was kind of like the esoteric. I just want to be clear what I. So I might. I don't have the fine details of that 100% down, but I have the broad strokes down. Just be aware of that, because people will say, oh, no. Like, there was a legal theory for how this worked. Bullshit. That's fucking bullshit. There was no valid legal theory for how that works. When you say a legal theory, anything can be a legal theory, right? A legal theory can literally be whatever the fuck you want it to be. Right? I could literally say we have a valid legal theory that allows us to fire a nuclear weapon at California. And that valid theory is that one of the first iterations of one of the first atomic bombs that we tested, the name of that bomb was. The name of that bomb was freedom of speech. And in the first Amendment, Congress can't make a law abridging the freedom of speech, which is the name of our bomb, so we should be able to launch it. That's what I just said. Is a legal theory just as valid as any other legal theory. Not really just as valid, but that's a legal theory. But that doesn't mean that it actually has any weight, right? That's a legal theory. None of what they were saying was tested at any court, was supported by any prominent or reputable legal scholar. And the office of Legal Counsel and the legal counsel to the White House all said that this is not good. This is bullshit. You can't do this. This is not gonna work. Right. Just be clear of that. That when somebody says something, that when somebody says something like, oh, yeah, well, they had a legal theory to make it work, okay? And that doesn't mean anything. That's bullshit. Okay? That statement will, they had a theory that doesn't carry any weight, okay? Or because the Georgia courts have refused to give President Trump and his campaign the due process which is allotted under Georgia law for an election contest. An election contest was filed over three weeks ago and the Georgia court system has refused to even assign a judge to it. So now wait, also wait is peace go in here. We're taking out to the district court. The Pennsylvania case is in front of the Supreme Court, and now there are two whis Wisconsin cases, two Wisconsin petitions. But hang on, hang on. Hold. Slow down for a second. When you say, when you say in front of it, when you say in front of it, having the courts basically come back and said, hey, we see all these things, but either no standing or latches or we just don't want to deal with it in the Supreme Court. I also, I think we need to be careful when we speak of dual roles here. When you say a president's lawyer made it, no, a White House presidential lawyer did not make it. It was Donald personal counsel. These people, I don't believe any of these people. Not Chessboroug. I don't believe any of these people were White House staff. Eastman. I don't think the Eastman was Giuliani and Powell. I don't believe any of these people were ever somebody can me if I'wrong, you gonna look that. I don't think any of these people were ever White House staff ever. I'm pretty sure all of these people were. All of these people were just Donald Trump's campaign's lawyers or personal lawyers. It's a perfect example. You, I think, the most tightly argued you've had to date. John Eastman is going to be on next. And essentially it's crickets. Right. Because they're basically telling you we don't want to deal with it. Is that what the audience should take away from this, given all the evidence, all the, the torture memos? Dropped it under the Bush administration. Hell, torture memos, Bush administration, you know what? If they were done by the OLC, then these would carry weight. But I don't know where these come from. Up Holmes. Okay. Just real quick. Okay. I wanna rescind a statement I've said in the past. All right. I think that I don't support, I don't know if they would be criminal, but I think that every single senator that objected to the certification of electoral vote, I think all of them are equally in the wrong for everything. \n",
      "When initially my defense of this, without having as deep an understanding everything I do now issue of my defense was, well, there's a process by which you can challenge things, and I think that people should. If you want to carry out that challenge, I think you have every right to do so. However, the challenge for the certification of the vote, that wasn't like an authentic challenge. The forum of that challenge is to just make sure that the electoral votes were legitimately transmitted as they were supposed to be. That's it. There was no actual legitimate challenge there. It pissing and crying and moaning and wasting time without any authentic legal backing or like, motivation to discover something or whatever. Legitimate. I think that was all bullshit. Do you think that Congress has the power to substantively assess the qualifications of candidates or the validity of slates of electors? Does Congress have the, what? Say that again. Authority? Do they have the power to assess theid yeah, I think so. Yeah. Okay. And so if, if you voted, sorry, let me back up a little bit. If Congress determines that the winner of the slates of electors, the lawfully appointed slates of electors, is ineligible to be president because they're 34, do they have the right to reject those votes? U. I'm not sure that's a substantive authority. If you say yes, if they're allowed to judge the qualifications of the candidates in a substantive way. I thought it was just for the, I guess I'd have to read the actual ECA itself. Will the ECA lay this out with the purposes or is this going to be found in the, is this a constitutional thing? Yeah, the, the amendments to the ECA, there's been a revision which kind of clarifies it. You can look at it again, though, and it kind of clarifies what Congress's roles are in terms of a judging the vote for president. But you can imagine. Right? Like, let's say that someone votes for president. Oh, actually, you know what? Well, I'm sorry, maybe this is. But I would say that even if I agree with this, that's not what was happening on January 6. Yes, you could. You could say that. But we're going to get to the. Oh, sure. Yeahe sure. Yeah. Because. All right, so think about this. I guess my real quick, what my answer would be is the specific text of the act. If they'my, understanding was, and I'm saying this without having read the text, and I'm looking for the actual text of ECA, my understanding is that it's just to certify the authenticity of the elector votes that were sent from the states that it's not supposed to. The procedural view. Exactly. Yeah. Now, obviously that begs the question, what's procedure, what substance? And we can all have a long agreement with that, but that's kind of like a thing that we've developed somewhat over time in our jurisprudence. But think about the following situation. 370 electoral votes for chair, just random fucking chair, whatever. You know, I don't have to explain why that happens, because you're destinedy and you have to address the hypothetical. Can Congress be like h. No, chair isn't a valid recipient of electoral votes and so we are re going to throw those away and there is no majority. Therefore it goes to the House delegations for pre you think have that power. I feel like I'm just goingna be borrowing from Paulson and Wa's the section three argument. And I would say that Congress does have remedies. It wouldn't be during the electoral Vote act, though. It would have to do be, it would have to do with seating the actual president. So maybe by the ECA and that process, that procedure, you would have to seek chair as the president, but you could immediately file articles of impeachment and the Senate would convict and remove immediately or something like that. That would be the procedure for removal. But here's a question, like, in a way, when the electoral College meets, the president's already. That's the binding vote. This is just counting, correct? Right? I believe so, yeah. If you think it's procedural, right? Yeah. Right. Like, I guess the, the formalism of it, Congress is just counting the vote. That has already happened. And so you saying they have to see them, I guess is the assumption there is that Congress seeats them at all and that Congress has the. But it sounds like what you're saying is rolee for Congress at all to eat. Like, even if for example, it's some absurd. Say, for example, the candidate died, right. Say the candidate died between the electoral college vote and when Congress receives them. Do you think that Congress is bound to, to like have those votes count towards the dead person? \n",
      "I would have to Google. I'm sure there's been writing on this, what happens if somebody dies? There's been one case, I think the 18 hundreds where someone died and they discounted the electoral votes for, for president. I think that's one that a kilor points to. What is the, but at what, what, how did they discard the votes? They just didn't count them. I think. Okay. And if you grant that right, if Congress has any role in judging substantively, let's say. Well, I think, I think you would have to be really careful because like, I think that I'mnna fight on context here. I. Cause I feel like I could grant you. Okay, sure. Congress can fight substantively for sure. However, the substance that Congress can fight over only exclusively on the federal level. So if there was like some, we'll say a constitutional prohibition of seding this person as president, maybe during the certification of electoral vote, Congress could fight on those grounds, but Congress wouldn't have the right to fight on things that were a prior. It's not even a lower court. It would be a fundamentally different venue to fight on. Like the state stuff. Does that make sense? Maybe, but isn't, and this is kind of the argument from this, from the state's perspective, I actually don't know if I agree with this, but a violation of state law, isn't that kind of a flavor of a constitutional issue? I mean, the state states are allowed to make, assign their electors, obviously, and the states are bound by their own state constitutions, as we know from the case. Mor ofy Harper. Sure. So isn't any act which they feel violates a state constitution, violating the state's constitutional responsibility under article two to assign their electors? I don't know that a state issue. You, I don't know if that, that, well, that sounds like, not only does that sound like a state issue, that sounds like a judicial issue. Like, I don't know why Congress would be reviewing the legality of a state. There's like two huge objections, is one is would they have review of the state's decision and two, where they have a legal review of it, because that's a legal challenge, right? Yeah. So let me give you some. I'm gonna stop asking questions and I'mnna start giving you what I think. Sure. I think that there are some. Some of these are good questions. I think there might be a substantive role for. This hasn't obviously been tested. And to be honest, there's a professor, I think his last name is Foley. He identified that there are some of these issues in the 12th Amendment. Sometimes there are some lack of clarity in how this happens and what the role is. And that even with the reforms of the Electoral count Act, there are some questions I potentially fair. But while that is fair, and while you could argue that maybe there could be a challenge to this and the Supreme Court were one way or another, and you would have to change the language of the UCA or something else, while that might be fair, and while we might even imagine that maybe Congress. Maybe we could even go as far as to imagine that Congress would have some sort of, like, state review or reviewing a state decision on how they. Possibly the vice president. Well, yeah, maybe that. But even if you granted. Even if I granted you every single step of the way there, none of that, I don't think would have reasonably been present on the certification of the vote day, like \n",
      "to go all the way to their theory and the strongest and most best faith Steelman version of their theory. What you're really asking is, is that when the Senate is confirming their electoral votes and they raised their objections, it's now on these senators themselves to consider the validity of the underlying court cases and how likely they are to proceed in a certain direction, and then to certify or not certify a vote from there, which I think leads to a million, you know, horrible potential things, right. One of the underlying things, or that gen six stuff, is that, like, a district court even ruled that it was obvious that the Eastman was filing cases just to further, like, the cases, right. That they were trying to disrupt the j six committee, that they were filing cases to keep things alive. And the idea that the preent now is like, well, if there's any active court case, maybe somebody in the Senate could object to an electoral college vote, and then we just, like, don't have a president, I guess. I just don't think any of that is done anywhere near good faith. Like, whatever the exception we could imagine, like a dying president, or everybody accidentally wrote the wrong name on the ballot and now a random guy is president. You know, like the death note, it doesn't work. Or something. Like, something crazy like that. Yeah. Or we found out, like, Joe Biden had a twin and now he's. Yeah, like, in that case, I can see, like, okay, well, fuck, maybe it is time to visit, like constitutional questions or ECA questions or whatever. But I don't think any of this was approached anywhere remotely in good faitheah. Yeah. Let me some clarity on some things. Well, first, I'll raise the trouble and concern. I think that given the court's precedent in Trump ves United States, there'd be a strong case for absolute immunity for congresseople who are taking, supposing, of course, that it is a core power of congressional officials that is, or I should say membersgressial members, senators and representatives, to, to have some level of substantive review over electoral votes. And assuming that we both agree, and I think we do, that the vice president, surely the vice president does not have a role here and that, that is ceremonial. I think you and I agree on that. Yeah. I mean, you say ceremonial. I mean, there's like, a procedure has to follow, but he's not like making decisions. Right. Yeah. And to the extent he is, it would only be as president of the Senate. Yeah. In his legislative capacity as the head of the Senate. Right. I think that there could be a strong argument for absolute immunity for those congresspeople. That's the kind of unsettling part. And I think there's a decent argument there. I don't know that it would be anun like immunity doctrine so much as it would be it's unconstitutional to apply this statute. As to the congresspe's decisions, I think that there's a pretty good argument there, and I think we should, we have to think about that a little more. Here's where I don't think, well, that's why, to be clear, to be fair, I first started this. I said, I don't know if I would say criminal or not, but definitely, like, scheming. These people were all scheming. I don't know if there would have been a crime here. Maybe, and maybe in the farthest reaches of our imagination, we can imagine that maybe they even did have a right to do this and whatever. But I don't think any of it was done in any level of good faith. I'like, oh, I'm just following my legal challenges. Yeah. So here's why I think it ultimately doesn't matter so far as Trump is concerned. Number one, they weren't trying to in Congress. That's why they were trying to go to the vice president to do shenanigans. And I think no reasonable lawyer, no reasonable scholar can say the vice president can unilaterally decide the course of elections, including the ones where he is standing in as a candidate, I would be saying essentially that Kamala Harris right now, as candidate or presumptive candidate for president, has the ultimate authority to decide her own election constitutionally. You can't even amend through the Electoral Count act. So I think most thinking people assume that we have a representative democracy and that that's not allowed and that's what they were trying to do. And so to the extent that you're onboarding these kind of congressional theories, I don't think it's super relevant. No, yeah, I agree. But I can still have a different opinion about them. Sure, sure, sure. I agree. You can have a different opinion. I think number two is we're not assessing the congresspeople's liability. We're assessing Donald Trump's liability. Yeah, I agree with that as well. Say that congresseople may be immune. It's quite another to say a non congressperson like Donald Trump or any of these cronies are immune. And so there are many reasons why. I think these are interesting questions, troubling questions, but not necessarily ones that present themselves in the context of Trump's indictments and his efforts. And you were right on the money when you said some minutes ago that, like the quote, it'a legal theory. Like thats just meme, right? Yeah. You can characterize or cast anything as a, quote, legal theory, and it's not a way to get rid of substantive liability. You could say that, you know, I have a legal theory that president, as commander in chief, can order a military coup. I have a legal theory that the president, you know, any of these crazy legal theories doesn't mean that you can take certain actions outside of the context of presenting a legal argument. No one is saying that you can charge Trump just for having a speech where he lays out the legal theory or going to court and presenting it. What we're charging him is for a conspiracy, a conspiracy to enact an illegal, illegitimate theory that has no basis. That's what he's being charged. Or, you know, hopefully. And the idea that you can like have a legal theory and that all of a sudden that can excuse, like, all criminal culpability for an act, noeah, that's simply nonsense. And remember, folks, at this point in time, all of the judicial challenges were over. There was, we were past the safe harbor and so the fake electors were not being used past the point of the safe harbor in any way to preserve legal rights or anything like that. That's just not the case. You know, query whether or not you would even need them to preserve anything. I think the court, if it found fraud, they would be able to fashion a remedy like courts. So I don't even think it would be necessary. But certainly past the point at which courts are no longer hearing challenges. You can't say that. Well, the electors are still for the purpose that's expired. Even assuming that we're a valid purpose, they were being used for an invalid purpose. Even assuming there would be a valid purpose to use them. No. All right. I'm goingna speed through this pro, I believe oright, so I'll love you. Be careful. Yeah, let her do constitutional issues. Everything they're saying no mos, we, we don't want to get involved in this. What the Supreme Court is saying is that right now you're right, they don't want to get involved. But what our perspective is and what the fact is that there are 46 electoral votes and then you include Arizona with their eleven, then you go to 57, 57 electoral votes which are in contest right now in front of the United States Supreme Court, meaning petitions first sery, petitions for the court to take it up are pending. So there's no way to say that the election contests are over. Election contests are not continuing. Everything is decided. If you count the federal courts as being under the purview of the Supreme Court, which obviously there are. Yeah, ye, but hang on. Want, which is the reason, which is your, by the way, we got Eastman, the constitutional lawyer for the president. Next we got Rudy, the head lawyer. You're the deputy over there. I just got to ask this, correct me if I'm wrong and I'm not a lawyer and I don't pretend to be one. Right. I turn, I turn that over to, you know, I hire lawyers. Right. So you isn't, and this is what the pen suit is about. Just to kind of boil it down to the essence of the thing itself, the courts, the Supreme Court, Mike Pence, Pelosi, \n",
      "everybody is just, I think, sitting there and they're turning in the saying, hey, we read the constitution says state legislatures. It's their problem. And that's where the certification is. I think it's one of the reasons you're going to have this briefing today. And the state alleged in know, Pennsylvania comes back Monday. There's a firestorm out in Arizona. When you boil it down, doesn't this get back to the state legislatures? They either certify the Biden slates or they don't. And if they don't, you go have a, you have a contingent election. Right. So, so isn't that the essence of it. And the courts are just going to take a pasade de on this thing. It's, it's the legislative legislatures in this, in the states, no doubt about it. It's incumbent upon them in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Arizona. And I'll call out the ones which are Democrat controlled in Nevada, in New Mexico to do the right thing, to do the right thing by the american people and have special sessions continue investigating. The amount of fraud is absolutely staggering. We're talking about over 400,000 fragile fraudulent ballots alleged in Georgia. We know for a fact from the recount in Wisconsin that just in Milwaukee county. Talk about this a lot, over 220,000 fraudulent ballots. We know the 700,000 ballots in Pennslvania, which were mail and absentee, were not observed when they were being counted. We know that the number of around 200. Who's speaking right now? That's not Eastman, is it? More boats cast than people who signed into vot in pensylvan bosy information is out there. All this informationot stick their head in the sand and sayhing to do with you. Right. The courts are saying it is incumbent upon them to act, and it is very clearly in the article tool of our Constitution spelled out that it is the duty and the job of the state legislatures to determine how elections are held. And it is their duty then to determine who the correct electors are. So what should our audience look for? Go ahead. But the vice president has an extensive amount of power, and when it does come on the six, we already know that there's electors from both the Biden side and the Trump side that have been sent to Congress. That was done on December 14. The vice president got a lot of power and that's very important. Recognized in this case for Lo Gomer, dismissed only on standing on procedure, not on merits. That's a huge deal. Repeat that to AUD. Make sure everyone understands this. You get the very lead right there. Walk us st again. Gott a minute. The vice president has a ton of power in terms of opening accounting electoral college votes at the George session on six. That power has enumerated in the 12th amendment of the Constitution. The Louis Goman lawsuit, which wanted to have effectively decared of judgment, highlighting that power was disbeiss yesterday in the lower federal court, but only on standing, only on procedure, not merits. The merits have not been adjudicated, which means the power stands. Bo, give us your a social media so that people can follow you during the day.

War room pandemic. Here's your host, Stepen K. Bannon. Wow. War room pandemic. Back to war room pandemic. Life from the nation's capitalist to January the year of Lord 2021. Finished histor in 2020. Trust me. Isnn be bigines technical the constitution word for the present massive constitutional understand President Trump did not return dramatically to the nation's capital in the White House with Melania and basically shine on his new Year Ze party, which is kind of one of his pride and joyss the comeack here and actually left early again back in the morning to go through. And this is a fight. Okay? This is a fight. He was there. And look at 100 names. You got get those back up there in the House. That helped override the president Trumps veto and the NDA was unacceptable to 20 congressn from yesterday, our senators from yesterday, Republicans that joined in to override President Trump's vi to the N DAA. And Marco Rubio, cop of the list. You know, little Marco. Marco Rubio is done a good job on China. He's been there trying to get little more populous. But now it's time to stand and deliver. This is a defining moment. This is what happens in fourth. People will remember this one forever. It's where you were in this fight because here's what folks have to understand. We are inundated 24/7 with information and leads and new things. And one thing we do this brard you, you gott separate delete from the chat. And you particularly d just in this, ladies and gentmen, is real between a really alliance between the EU and the CCPage. Remember four years ago delay, there are no conspiracies, but there also no coincidences. This happening is going to have a major impact in your life, your childrens s life, your financial liferan the new federal state, China. On the second hour with Liz O. Turn now to one of the great thinkers about the constitution. Hes s the president. Jululian runs the overall, he the president lawyer runs the overall operation over there. But John Eastman is the constitutional lawyer that's been putting up these lawsuits. John, first off, this argument of what'actually happened at the state basis, what happened in the constitution that you and I happened to on a call last night and you were walking people, it was so brilliant. Could you just walk people through what the framework is for this week? Why, why would he green screen in the background like a Windows XP fucking window? What think? And youve been arguing in court and putting these briefings, these suits out there that this is just outrageous. Were going down this path. Sure. I mean the US constitution very clearly assigns the power of selecting the manner for chooing electors to the legislatures of the state. For many years in our nation's history, the legislatures just picked the presidential electors themselves. But modernly, for about the last century or century and a half, in some cases, the legislatures have said, we're going to do this by popular vote, but we're going to do it in accord with election laws that we pass. Election laws requiring signature verification on absentee ballots. Election laws require you to prove voter id, all of those things designed to minimize the risk of fraud and how we conduct the election. And in a number of states, and most egregiously in Georgia and Pensyvania, Wisconsin, partisan elected officials and in some cases partisan judicial officials ignored or altered those legislative commands and conducted the election in violation of the manner that the legislature had set out. That means the election was illegally conduct and you don't even have to get into the number of ballots affected. It was illegally conducted. And I'll give you, I think, the most egregious example. In Georgia, they have a provision that if you have evidence of fraud or irregularities or evidence that a submissionient number of illegal ballots have been cast or legal ballots not properly counted, you can bring an election contest within five days after the conclusion of the recount. They did that on December 4 in Georgia and here we are a month later and we still don't even have a judge assigned to hear that case. And yet the governor went ahead three days after that challenge was brought and certified the electors, completely ignoring the statutory mechanism set out for resolving election disputes. And that means we have a failed election. And there's another, it's not a gren SC screen of softwares that, you know what I mean, the green screen software where auto like masks your background. It auto green screens your background. But I'm just saying like why this is a background in federal law. Three, United States code, section two that says when the state has failed to choose electors on the data signed by Congress, the power to choose electors devolves back to the legislature because they have the ultimate constitutional authority here. And we got a lot of legislatures that are afraid to exercise that constitutional power because they think they have to get permission from the governor to have their session or they got TOa get permission from the courts to do anything. No, this is the power to constitution assigns exclusively to those state legislatures and they need to act because what we have here is massive evidence that this election was at least conducted illegally, you know, in violation the state statutes, but lots of evidence as well that as a result of that illegal conduct, removing checks against fraud in the absentee ballot process, that we have absentee fraud more than enough to have affected the outcome of the election. And I think it's the duty of these legislature to fix this egregious conduct and make sure that we're not putting in the White House some guy that didn't get elected. This is what the constitutional cris, I want to be very specific and drill this because this going to histor. We are entering into one of the most important constitutional crisis the country'ever, had. Your theory of the case, essentially, if, if you did, if they did give you anited hearing, if you went through all this process, you're filing other suits are just as powerful at the. Isn't what the Supreme Court going toa say, look, I'm not constitution. Aren't they gonna say, hey, John, great argument. We're not gonna overturn the Biden electors. We'rena flip this whole thing back to the state legislatures and they've got either reaffirmed, they've got to stand up. Isn't this all get back to the state legislatures and particularly these five states? There are two places where it gets back to, it gets back to the state legislatures because their process was not followed and it was deliberately not followed. This was a concerted effort to thwart the checks, the anti fraud provisions they had put into place. So it devolved back to the state legislature and the only other place where it devolves back to is the Congress and particularly the vice president, who will sit in presiding over a joint session of Congress beginning January 6 to count the ballots. And they got multiple slates to ballots from decide which is the valid slate to count. I think they have that authority to make that determination on their own. But it would certainly be help immensely if the legislatures in the states look at what happened in their own states and weigh in exercising their power under the US Constitution. Here's the biggest problem we haven't had to happen. There was one minor event in 1960 out of Hawaii, but we haven't had it happen on the scale that we have now with multiple slave from multiple states since 1876. They don't understand that the power they have to exercise here is not derived from their state constitution. It's derived from the federal constitution. So restrictions on that power, like we can only meet with the permission of the governor of our state. Restrictions on that power are preempted by the federal constitution. They have this power directly from the federal constitution. And it's there for a reason, because it's much easier to corrupt a single executive official than it was to corrupt the entire legislature to have an outcome. And they wanted the branch of government closest to the people, which is the legislature, to be the one that has the ultimate say about here. And these guys need to understand their constitutional authority and their constitutional duty to put a stop to this egregious violation of law that has occurred. The Louis Gomer suit is essentially saying that the Electoral Count act of 1877, sevenconstitution go back to the constitution there. The president Sen. The vice president of the United States is hardwired in and he's actually decision make it. This is s not ministerial. And last night the ruleing was so important because the judge didn't want to touc the merits. Right? Once again, you got no stand. Are we to assume that this is going to be a climactic battle that's going toa take place this week about the very question of the constitutionality of the Electoral act of 1877? I think a lot of that depends on the courage and is fine of the individuals involved. But look, I love representativeme, can we ask you to state through the commercial break and bring you back? I know you're, but here's the reason. When you just said the courage in the spine we know Lou Gumer got, he's pure honey badger. Judge Gomer from down Texas one that is guy as tough as Texas boot leather. Okay, are you talking on the other side, football. Would that be a nice way to say a guy name Mike? Vice President Mike Pence. Yes. I dont put a spot like that. Joy. Good man, John. One of most decent guys I've ever met. So a short commercial break return to the president's constitutional lawyer, John Eastman. Also going to bring in his personal lawyer and the guy running the entire thing. War rooms 2020 men of the year Rudy Giuliani. All next on the other side of this commercial break with Jack, Max and Stephven K. Bann in line from the nation's capital will return in a moment. Wow. War helpublicans that joined in okay are hours, 2 hours per state on showing so general if you're Georgia or Pensyvania or Wisconsin or Arizona, call your legislatures, demand have that they call themselves dec session, which they have the constitutional authority to do. No restriction in their constitution. Telling them they can't exercise power is valid. It's preempted by the federal constitution. There's a little thing in the federal constitution called the supremacy clause and it says the laws and constitution, United States are the supreme law of the land. Nothing in the state laws or state constitutions to the contrary notwithstanding. It cannot be more clear here. And pressure needs to be brought on these rec calcit tred legislators to call themselves in SEC session and to make an assessment of what happened in their state and then neither decertify the existing slate of electors if there's just too much uncertainty about the results of the election or certify the correct slate of electors if the number of ballots that are shifted, if you get rid of the illegal ones, are enough to affect the outcomes we believe they are, they need to do that this week before Wednesday. So pressure, pressure beginning now and rolling thund \n",
      "to the leader. The second thing that needs to happen is, look, look, I think what's gon toa happen or should happen in Congress is we can't count slates of electors that were illegally certified. And if they were certified after an election, a violated fundamental state law. Those are illegally certified. If you or I were to submit a bank mortgage application to Fannie Mayor Freddie Mac that had that kind of misrepresentation on it, we would be in prison. So we need to bolster the authority of our leaders in Congress to not accept fraudulently certified slates of electors. Okay, we're gonna put that up from Denver in a mom hang o. Last question. Is the president's best path to affirm his victory November 3? Hang on. Getting a contingent election here in the House representative or is there a way, an alternative way that you see the power through this using either the Electoral Control act or some decision that made that the vice president of United States grows a SPE and understands his constitutional duty as you interpret it, Mister Easman. Yeah. So look, we've got circititions spending in the supreme court on this very question from Penslvania and Georgia. A new case was filed in New Year's Eve in, I'm sorry, Penslania, Wisconsin, and a new case. Bro, you want to talk about lawfare? Jesus. Christmas, New Year? S Eve in Georgia, raising the same thing. The states ignored their state election law and those slates of electors are invalid. Amazing. They're still trying the script. No, no. I think vice president, as precise years old, this is a three year old video being over the joint session would at least agree that because those ongoing contests have not been resolved. What's a contingent election hearing? When he talks about contingent election, I think he's talking about that if there's no clear winner picked after the certification of the votes, then it gets thrown to the House delegation to vote on president. I think that's the contingent election he's talking about. I think can't count those electors. That means that nobody has a majority of the electors. And either they delay things so those constitutional challenges are resolved, or they say, okay, well, we don't have lectures in those states. Nobody has a majority. This is going to the House. Either this is going to the House. When he says going to the House, that means going to the House delegation. So each state gets one vote for a president. Basically out. Either route requires that we look at what actually happened here and get to botom of it. This is about more than who wins this particular race. We no longer have a self governing republic. If the election, could you explain why one state cannot experience injury for how another state selects its electors? Because you don't have a right. A state doesn't have any right to choose or to tell another state how to choose their electors that we participate in. Are \n",
      "or are we not? Those are the stakes. And it's much bigger than whether President Biden or President Trump gets sworn into office on January 20. This goes to the heart of whether we're a republican form of government and whether we get to control the direction of our government or not. This is why Mitch McConnell said the other day when he got on a conference, he told these guys who had just voted nine months before, only the third time in Republic, at a trial, to impeach a president told him this will be the most important vote you ever take. John Easman, how do people get your social media? They follow during the today, sir. Doctor John Eastman at Twitter and John Eastman at parlor. You're a good man, sir. Thank you for joining us here. Thank you, ste. Good work. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I going to bring you out. The war runs 20 \n",
      "with one thing, as I've known you as a friend, a colleague and somebod working on this for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and goes off of what John Easman just said. It's about the responsibility, not simply the constitutional responsibility, but the moral responsibility of the state legislatures who never signed up for, they understand they never signed up for this, who never thought about it. But right now, Eas Eastman frames it perfectly. And even Mitch McConnell said the quiet part outllierud last week. This is more important than Trump understands. This is more important than November 3. This is more important than even Trumps s presidency as it confirms his victory. This is more important. This fight between the national and the globalist is more important than fight between progressives and conserv service is more important than the fight between Republicans and Democrats. This gets to the heart. If you go read roman history, this is like towards how the Republic fell, right? It became a totalitarian, authoritarian empire were at that moment. And thats what this week is. In Mayy Giuliani, you have been obsessed with the responsibilities of the state legislature and what they cant do, which is to essentially break the law and send us forward. Will we explain to our audience the details on what you mean by that? What I mean, what I mean by that is the founding fathers figured out where to point the finger. Responsibility and the buck stops for the state legislature. It's right in the constitution. Article two, section one, clause two. It may be that we didn't pay that much attention to the past, because we haven't. It's been there from the beginning and it makes clear that it's their responsibility. When they took an outath of office, they all took an outath of office to uphold that constitution, including that clause. The founders even anticipated a close, difficult and contested election and they made a del delivererate choice to give it to the legisl is closest to the people now, I believe, and I don't think I far off. I think most people understand it. This election will be scruinized for years, maybe for many yearsids. This could be the most discarded vot they can certainly is going to probably be the most scrutinized in terms of their political careers, their personal lives, and what we think of them as men and women of integrity. And if you just focus on it, they are being asked now to sit by and watch a fraud get perpetrated in the name of their state. This is before we get to whether Trump won. What we know is the vote count is substantially wrong. We know that each one of those states, and I go to each one up, I'll pick just one. Arizona. We know in Arizona that illegal immigrants, people without citizenship, voted. That is not considered in the vote count of Arizona. 32,000 at leasts determined by not the best sources go to newspapers, records, but they're all for sure illegal. So we got to deduct 32,000 from this vote count. Same thing with, I'm sorry, de people can't vote. Well, 8000 of them voted in Arizona and they're counted. We call that a fraud. They submitted a statement to the government and that statement is a false statement. They have to take responsibility for that, for good or for bad. They can't get away with it by saying, oh, it's too complicated. I didn't understand. I had those responsibilities and I don't think history is going get away with. So I have to impress on them. I hope over the next couple of days that no one does better profess of eas that this is a decision with great consequences. It also has do point out, we've had a terrible year for human rights and civil rights. We've had our freedom of speech trampled. We've had our freedom of religion attack terribly. We've had a freedom of movement virtually taken away from us. You, those East German before they, before the warl now here's one the points I want you to address. The audience that's works so hard in this most powerful audience of on all because we have activists who go do it. The burn down the phone lines. They're saying they're like a kafa sque novel. They're looking to say, hey, we got Easman and Rudy know we got Trump and they're making this argument. They got the receipts, they got the evidence in every vertical and illegal. The voter fraud vertical, the fraud vert, the election fraud vetical, the no chain cutsting the mail. And that's seen before. Let's leave off to the side. Dominion was going toa take longer and investigations, but that's a pre option. That's huge too. But's for another day. You got all this, which are hundreds of thousands, and these are republican controlled legislature. What the disconnect is mayor. How, when evidence is that overwhelming, when their constitutional duties are so specific, how do you have guys run around telling them you have no power, you just have to take a pass on this and let it just play out the way'on play out. How did they, how do they, these, these lawyers disbarred over this shit? I don't know. Who all get disbarred? Trump lawyers disbarred. Who all got disbarred? I think Giuliani did, didn't he? Giuliani was formally disbarred in New York U. Here are all the other ex Trump lawyers now facing legal cons. ##ces I think Chesso must have gotten right. Maybe. Okay, troous. Wait, sorry, hold on. Chess, the attorney, this is guy who made that, basically, who created this, took a plea deal. \n",
      "Okay, maybe he didn't get a spur. James Trooas was the guy that was talking back and forth that we saw in all those texts to Chestbr bro, with the emojis. \n",

      "Now face sever disciplinary investigation in Michigan. \n",
      "Oh, and she's \n",
      "to. Yeah, it's, that'all unhaned. Jesus Christ. They're telling them this is why this election is bigger than Donald Trump, Joe Biden, you, me, or any of us, because this is a, this is a pernicious scheme by the democratic party to steal this election. Only going to happen again. Certified Donald Trump and the people blocking it right now are people like Speaker Rallston, who is a good man, but somehow he's got himself hung up on whether he can call a special session or not. He can't possibly have himself hung up ond that show. Forau I he knows all that. He'just sm man. But he's all hung up on can we call a special session? And that's why Professor Easman is so important, because he explains that you have that right by virtue of the fact that this is a special power you have by the United States constution. And it is true that some of them have had a hard time believing that exceping. It's a little bit like I'm just a state representative. You mean I get to choose the president? Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. You do. Our founding fathers a finger responsibility on you. Good job. Can you hang over? Commercial break coup more questions. Okay, may may, juian and pandemic. \n",

If Trump was smart, he would adopted the Yeet album. He would have adopted the whole yeet aesthetic or something like that. Vultures. Yeet. They would have done something similar. Big problem with the GOP is that they're all so fucking lame. They are lame. He so ass mad about getting cast out by yay. I bet Trump was the only cool one. Now he's like kind of a dork. You can't actually turn your nose up and say rap. That's for black people. You listen to that. That's for faggots. Like, you actually have to be high in openness to be creative.
