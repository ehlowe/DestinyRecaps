The huge issue that we have right now is the fact that you can walk up to the border and claim asylum. That's the big issue right now. The reason why it's impossible right now for the government to do anything is because of the laws on the books. If an immigrant comes up to the border and they say, we want to seek asylum, you basically have to cut them a ticket and say, okay, well, here's your hearing. It's in like two years because we've got like a 2 million, 3 million cases backed up right now.

That the reason why the numbers have grown so much and the reason why the apprehension rates have grown so much like it used to be, that I think you'd only catch like, 50 or 60% of the people crossing. And that number is in the nineties now. And I think the reason why that number is so high is because I don't think as many people are trying to cross illegally, they just go up and they seek asylum. Let me see if I can find this. It was in research subs. Immigration. Fuck. What did I feel like I had a link saved here for this. There are no limits on the number of individuals who may be granted asylum each year, nor are there categorical limitations. Ordinarily, for us immigration policy, we restrict the number of people coming based on certain countries being overrepresented or we have hard cap. But the asylum process, there is no cap.

How do you cap asylum? It's not known, actually, if you can cap asylum too. That's another challenge for international law reasons and for us law reasons, anybody here's a good heuristic when it comes to immigration as well. When somebody wants to talk about issues at the border and they give you one number and they build their, and they build their entire argument off of one number, they probably don't have a good understanding of anything relating to immigration. CA because all of these numbers are like, dependent on other things, and they vary for a variety of reasons. So, for instance, looking at apprehensions at the border doesn't necessarily give you a good key into what's happening, because apprehensions going up could mean that less people are coming in, or apprehensions coming up could mean that just more pe\",\n",

But there are more people as an absolute value that are coming in, or apprehensions going up or apprehensions going down, for instance, could mean. So I believe these are the numbers recently. Somebody can fact check me, look at this if you wantong. But I believe, like right now, I think the apprehensions on everything aren't as relevant right now, even as a percentage of the people that they think are crossing. Because, again, people aren't trying to cross illegally, and people aren't being apprehended across. They just walk up and they claim asylum. So even if those numbers are going down, CA because I think right now, I think we're apprehending, historically a very, very, very high percentage of the people trying to come over, but it doesn't matter because they just claim asylum, and then you're kinda like, fucked.

Traditionally, like, a republican supporter, there is one policy that, there's one policy that Biden changed that I think Trump had a better policy on, and I think that was called, I think it was the remain in Mexico thing, where I think in the United States for a while, if you came to seek asylum, while you waited for that to process, I think you had to wait in Mexico while it'processed. But I think overall, the amount of asylum seekers that that influenced coming over, I think ended up being. It was like 50,000. I don't think it was a big amount, but that would be, like, one thing that I think is probably better. Did I write anything on this? No. Fuck. You should look more into remain in Mexico.

Why did Biden step down? I think it, well, one of the things that I said, I always say this when people talk about, like, because people ask me, like, oh, talk to the keys for the election guy. What about this? That this predicts everything? People always say, like, XYZ predicts everything for the election. You get these things, you win the election, or this has mattered, or this hasn't mattered.

Do you think that Kamala'presidency will live up to Biden's. I have no idea. Who knows? For the next four years, nobody knows what they're going to look like. I think it's obvious why asylum is not capped. It should be people running from persecution. But as you mentioned, the issue is an enforcement sorting out who's legit. Yeah, I mean, like in a perfect world, but again, you can't even have these conversations because Republicans are deranged. But in a perfect world, asylum shouldn't be uncapped, right?

That if you want products, if you want goods and services that are made in America that aren't imported for anywhere, you're going to be paying a higher price for it.

We'ren to be clear, this is what we expect, and then we're gon toa be consistent. Even if the administration's change, we're gon to roughly remain on the same path. That's number one. All.

It is supposed to be, but everything's power has its, like, like, like cons to it. Right. Like the legislature absolutely, undeniably has the most power, but it also, like, requires the most, like, inertia to overcome. Yeah. In order to get that power executed. Right.

The branches are separate and they're all important, but Congress is always intended to be the most powerful branch. It'the one that can amend the Constitution. It Corre, in theory, got the final hand on top, like you said.\\n\\nDestiny: And you have to remember that for Marb E. V. Madison, the Supreme Court was supposed to be the final say on resolving disputes for cases that would either come up federally or to resolve disputes between states or to resolve disputes relating to, like, treaties. I think that's what the Supreme Court was supposed to do. And it was onlyial review. Yes. The Supreme Court technically. Wait, what?\\n\\nC: I disagree with that reading that the Supreme Court, like, usurped itself.\\n\\nDestiny\",\n",
       "   \": Well, hold on. I saying, I'm not saying it usurped itself. I'm just saying that I't, it wasn't originally written, at least by text, that the Supreme Court had the power to declare a law from the legislature unconstitutional. That s, that's tr, that it can, because I think there were some, I don't remember quote, but some of the people that were originally, when they were driving the constitution didn't think that Congress would ever do that. Well, Congress wouldn't pass a law that's unconstitution. They can't. Or that. So, yeah, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nC: Here's my response to that real quick. I mean, you could imagine them coming up with something that said, it is emphatically the providence duty of the legislature to say with the laws instead of the judicial branch.\\n\\nDestiny: Right.\\n\\nC: I understand that, that it's not explicitly written, but if you read the federalist papers, there's a reference to judicial review in one of them.

Interesting.\\n\\nC: You not like\",\n",

Isn't that what Robert said, that we have to, or was it Alito that said that? No, it was Robert that wrote that opinion. Congress didn't make a law enforcing equal protections from the 14th amendment. And I thought that's what section five said. That's the argument that we use to get rid of section threeing legisl, saying that. Yeah, that was, that was like the. I believe that was the central argument that they used to say that the states can't enforce us yeah, that was what Robert said.

So they're just like they're paying taxes sometimes into systems and then they don't actually get anything back for it because they can't access any of those like welfare benefits or anything else. So they just end up.\\n\\nD: Or the fact that, like, if we think about, if we understand that the welfare state is mostly a system to help non workers, which is definitively the case, our two biggest pieces of welfare spending that we do, like half the federal budget or some crazy percentage, you know, 40% of it is just Medicare and Soci\",\n",

And so those people pay into systems more so than they take out of them because welfare is not a system to give poor people money. It's a system to give non workers money. And so you let in a bunch of workers, you're going to be able to fund your systems a lot better. So the fiscal arguments have obviously always been pretty crazy. Like some conservatives will say, oh, well, what about all the kids that go to public school? It's like, yeah, but those kids are fiscal multipliers, right?

Marbury is probably the most famous Supreme Court case that granted the Supreme Court the ability to have judicial review, which gives them the ability to take a law from Congress and say, this law doesn't comport with the Constitution. So we're going to strike down this law, right? We proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government.

The manner of constituting. It seems to embrace these several objects. First, the mode of appointing judges. Two, the tenure by which they are to hold their places. Three, the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other.

And then when the agency is created, the president of the United States has the ability to appoint the head of an agency. For the big ones, this is called his cabinet, are composed of these people, and the heads are called their officers. The president, unless Congress says explicitly authorized, the president has the right, granted by the Constitution to appoint or to nominate for appointment an officer the head of an agency or an office. And then with the Senate, we'll confirm that. And then that's where these agent heads come from. Right? Or officers. Right. I don't think we usually call them officers anymore. We call them cabinet members or we call them the heads of agencies, but, yeah. Second. And they're saying, well, we've already talked abo\",\n",

According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior, which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions, and among the rest, to that of this state. Its propriety, having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection. Which disorders their imaginations and judgments. Damn. Wait, who wrote like 70? What did we read before? Who wrote federal paper 70? Hold on. This. Okay. Damn. Okay.

And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws. So a lot of the federalist papers, they talk about, like, the british system, they talk about monarchies, and in here they're saying, well, a strong judiciary, it can protect a prince from anything, and it can evenect.

Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive that in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution, because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can \",\n",

So here they're saying that, like, well, we shouldn't be threatened by judges in terms of how they can attack us, because the judiciary basically can only hold the executive to account and prevent the legislature from doing wacky shit. They can't. The judges are neither executors of power. Nor are they writers of legislation for power. Right. The simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.

But that would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments, saying that. So a judiciary that stands on its own. Should never threaten liberty. But a judiciary aligned with one of the the other departments. Would be a grave threat. Which makes sense, remember, because up here, he said that a judiciary could protect a corrupt prince.

And in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security. So, arguing that because these other two branches are so politically beholden. That the judiciary should stand as lifetime appointments. Essentially because it insulates them from the political pressures of Congress or the executive right. The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution.

A bill of attainder is a law that punishes a person or group without a judicial trial. Okay, okay. And the like. So this is saying that a limited constitution is one that even the legislature is not allowed to pass, a law that would arrest people with no due process or pass laws that would criminalize past behavior, that you would now be held criminally liable for. Right.

It is urged that the authority from it is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the american constitutions, a brief discussion. The ground on which it rests cannot be accept, cannot be unacceptable. So some people argue that, oh, well, fine, if the judiciary can just nullify anything from the legislature, it must be superior to the legislature. And Hamilton says, just because you can say that an act coming from them is void doesn't mean that you have more power than the people passing the act. So that's not true.

If you delegate it, you can't. Something that's contrary to the tenor of the commission would be void. You can't have the constitution granting something to the legislature, and then the legislature defies the constitution, then the defiance would make whatever that act isoid avoid act essentially right.

And that the construction that they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered that this cannot be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. Whenever you see the word construction, I believe that construction refers to the idea of deciding whether or not a particular thing is in concordance with the thing that authorizes it, with the law that authorizes it. So when you talk about statutory construction, you're talking about a judiciary system reviewing a thing or somebody reviewing a thing saying, does this comport with the law? I think that's statutory \",\n",

That would be a statutory construction. So this is saying you can't allow the body passing laws to do statutory construction on their own. That would be ridiculous, because then they could pass whatever they want and decide whatever they pass is legal. They'd have no check on their power there. It is not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to sub substitute their will to that of the constituents. It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact, and must be regarded by the judg\",\n",

Or in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people, to the intention of their agents. So basically saying that, like, if there's a disagreement between what a judge would say, Congress says versus what the Constitution says, the Constitution is not federal law. Okay, I kind of argued with this. I don't know what a law professor would say. This is a feeling that I have. I could be wrong. If there's a federal or if there's a constitutional law wants to disagree, feel free to let me know. But, like, I don't think it'you, shouldn't conceive of the constitution as federal law. It's not.

And if you have an irreconcilability between a federal law and the Constitution, the Constitution is always preferred, because you're not comparing one law to another. You're comparing the supreme law or the Constitution to a statute or law passed by the Congress which gets its power or authority from the Constitution. Right? And they're saying that obviously it's the judiciary that makes these decisions. Nor does this conclusion, by any means, suppose the superiority of the judicial to the legislative power.

Right. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by those which are not fundamental. Constitutional law versus statutes passed by Congress this exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two contradictory laws is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation, so far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconci',\n",

They stand a direct opposition. Right. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the last, in order of time, shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing.

So obviously saying that a court should rule in concordance with the superior governing authority, even if an inferior one disagrees at a later point in time. It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature.

The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals. From the effects of those ill humors which the arts of designing men or the influence of particular conjectures, sometimes conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the meantime to occasion dangerous innovations in the government and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community.

Right, though I trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness.

The legislature should not have the ability to do that. The judiciary will hold firm and do their constitutional interpretations as such. And if the legislature really wants to fight the constitution, they need to change the constitution. They can't put themselves above it. They have to change it.
