What about this opinion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I feel like it's worse than uhm. It's hard to say yet. I feel like it's worse than what people worried about initially. That's the feeling. Right. But maybe as I get through more, maybe they'll hedge somewhere where I feel like it's not quite as bad as it seems, but it seems pretty bad. It just seems like a very bad ruling. But I don't know."}]}

That's so one of the most epic things is that we're in the year 2024 and there are still things that when you double clip them on windows, terminal opens and then it instantaneously closes. I love that. I think it's so intuitive and it makes sense. Like, why would you not have that feature still on your operating system after 50 fucking years of existing? Like, who knows what? Just open. And maybe it ran with admin and maybe it just fucking put a keylo logger my. I don't even know. I don't care. I just double click it 30 fucking times. I'm gripping it in. Griffing it right in. Yes."}]}

I think that Ben Shapiro said this, and I agree with him. I've said this for a long time. I'm sorry. He agrees with me. Okay. That the United States needs to be more honest about our foreign policy. We need to be honest about what we're trying to achieve and what we're doing, rather than this weird, like, oh, we want to spread democracy, everybody. That bullshit. That's not true. Our goal is for the safety and security of the United States and US interest and allies here and abroad. That's what us foreign policy should be about. And that's a good foreign policy, by the way. It's practically defensible insofar as, like, our economy and our relationships with other people go. And I think it's morally defensible. I would rather the US be in charge of world affairs than fucking China or Russia. I think we conduct ourselves in a morally superior way, not perfectly, but in morally superior, not perfectly, but in a morally superior way to those countries."}]}
