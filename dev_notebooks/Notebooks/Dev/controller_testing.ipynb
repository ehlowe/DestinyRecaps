      "Destiny: Damn. He didn't do like an intro or anything. He just sat around, was like, she. I don't even think she's fully seated yet. And he's like, give us an opening. Holy.\n",

      "\n",
      "C: As I said, well, I don't really feel like I have a opening statement. In some ways, I feel as though the reality of what's been happening on the ground for the last 7th months speaks for itself. People who started out at the beginning of this conflict feeling very strongly that Israel merited a response to an attack which, as we all know, was the deadliest since the Holocaust, have now, after seeing seven months in which 34,000 conservatively, people have been killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Conservatively. Well, technically, now it's like, conservatively would be 25 or something. Thousand. Right. You can't tell if something looks appealing or not. Are you this fashion retarded? No. You have to develop a taste or an intuition for what looks good or not. You don't just have it automatically. Pretty sure what looks good to some people doesnen to other people. In different countries and through time, different things have looked good or not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Three quarters of whom are women and children, feel like enough is enough. And so if this framing of this conversation is, has Israel gone too far? I think that's almost a different question from whether or not or what the future of Palestinians, but the future of Gazans in particular, should be. So I think I, I started there and I'm interested to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "B: Fine. Let me just jump in, though, because the theotion is, is it a just war? Rather than has Israel gone too far? Do you feel it's a just war? Do you feel it's a just war?\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: International law gives us two good guiding principles for evaluating the justness of a particular conflict. You have your use adllum and use imbe bello. The two different concepts are one has to do with your right to go to war, and the second has to do with your conduct in war. If you're familiar with both of these terms, it can help you give a better answer, because you might be able to say, for instance, I think that Israel had a right to go to war, but I believe their conduct in war is unacceptable. Or you might even say for Hamas. I think that the Palestinians have a right to resistance. I think their cause for war was righteous, but their conduct in war is not righteous. If you don't have in your mind the template for these two thoughts, it becomes very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate the conduct, or'm sorry, it becomes difficult to navigate that conversation, because now you're stuck defending or rejecting the entirety of what's going on, we'll see how she answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: No, I'm struggling because I don't think I would characterize it as a war at all, given how one sided it is and given that one side is being denied the right to have a state in the first place.\n",
      "\n",

I don't think I've ever read the term like war. Like, this is how we define war. I think it's always just described as like, armed conflict, international or non international. So. But this is. Yeah, war is more typically one of the reasons why reading stuff and having a working, like, fluid vocabulary in a particular field is valuable is because when you hear people use certain terms, you can very quickly discover, like, where are you at in this conversation? Like, how much have you read? How much have you not read? And all of you know this because if you guys work in certain jobs or if you have certain interests, there's a vocabulary that you develop very quickly. There's an understanding you develop very quickly, such that if somebody to ask you a question about something or say a particular thing, you could very quickly identify, like, wait, hold on. I don't think that you're a part of my tribe, or I don't think you're a part of, like, this community. If you're saying things like this, you know, you can just identify very quickly. Now, maybe she's read different stuff and maybe my vocabular lary isn't as deep as hers, whatever. So, you know, who knows? But we'll find out.\n",

So probably be like, it'd probably be like your, like most of Europe except for eastern and southeastern Europe. It would be the US, Canada, and then probably like New Zealand and Australia would be like the western world. I think you would say. Can you explain what he means by identity politics?

      "Destiny: The ultimate cause of the zionist project was because Jews felt and probably were, were persecuted throughout the entirety of the world through basically the last 2000 years of history. And Jews were like, I feel like it'be cool if we had a place of our own so that we didn't have to get fucked by everybody. Essentially, that's the zionist project. So his opposition here, if you take what he'saying, at face value, is that he's opposed to the creation and the existence of an ethnically jewish state. He is an opposition to that. I don't know if he felt that it was unfair in the 18 hundreds and the 19 hundreds for them to fill away or what? But I don't know. Okay, generally as a progressive, and generally if you're arguing from a pro palestinian perspective, I don't think you want to go with the anti zionist argument because you're immediately going to be lumped into an antise semitic argument. And truthfully, it's going to be pretty hard to separate yourself from that. That's a pretty crazy, like maybe not to be jewish, but maybe absent the Holocaust, you could say that that's kind of ridiculous argument. But keep in mind the Holocaust happened after Jews were already like, man, bro, we're getting, we need to get the out of Europe and the rest of the world. And then the Holocaust happened. So that's a pretty rough one to.\n",

Because if you don't even have one in mind, then how do you even know this one is bad? Are you really? One of my biggest problems with a lot of the propality arguments is they try to use a bunch of these arguments to say that this particular thing is not acceptable. But really in their mind, what they want is just a cessation of the war completely, no matter what, period, full stop. That's it. They don't want the war happening at all. And then they try to find a lot of small arguments'like, oh, that's why when people come in my chat, they're like, oh, did you see this last thing that Israel did? Does this make you against the war? Now it's like, wait, what? No, I don't know if anything could make me against the war in terms of cause for the war. I mean, there's a certain amount of conduct that would make me say, okay, well, Israel's not conducting this war in a good way. People e need to be arrested, held accountable in some other way. Leadership needs to change, or maybe if it's really bad, the war needs to end. But people are always just looking for these micro arguments around the edges. But really what they want is just a total cessation of the war and usually a disassembly of the state of Israel. But that's a further argument you don't have to make. But more often than not, that's what it ends up being.\n",

But my understanding was that the AI is deployed in early parts to identify targets, but there's still human intervention at the end to okay, things are to fact check stuff. I've never does it saything. I don't know if I have time or even the desire to read this whole thing, but I've never heard that the AI thing was used from start to finish. Yeah, I don't think any target is done unilaterally with AI, but I mean, I guess I can't make that strong statementamp with this small article also, but we'll see if they respond.\n",

      "C: AI that was being used to assess whether or not a given target should be targeted and killed. And when human judgment was a bigger part of the equation, one, there was an oversight that didn't exist. When you're just letting the computer, run it. But one of the more pernicious aspects of the AI is that they had. Whereas human judgment would say, if it's a very, very high ranking person, there's a more risk tolerance. If it's a low ranking person, there's less risk tolerance. There was a conflation of who was actually targeted in the first place, and the evidence that was being used to target someone in the first instance was very flimsy. So if you lived in the same household with someone who might be a member of Hamas and were once on the same cell phone plan, you are a target. Very flim.\n",

      "Destiny: If so, the fact that he doesn't have an answer here is a little bit of a red flag. I wouldn't expect him to have an exact answer, but we went over this before when it came to like policing in the United States. There's a good Scott Alexander article on this, that people will have an outrage, but they can't moderate it based on information. It's just a vibe. So if I tell you, for instance. Okay, well, last year, 1000 unarmed black men were killed by 100,000 police in the United States, how would that make you feel? Okay, well, that's horrible. Sounds bad. What did I say? 100,000 killing 1000. Well, what if I say there's not actually 100,000 police in the United States? There's a million police, right. And the number of encounters is actually ten times higher than you thought. Does that make you feel one 10th as bad? Okay, well, I thought we only had 100,000 police, and these 100,000 police had managed to kill a thousand black people each. I thought one out of 100 police officers executed a black man. Well, now I find out the number is only one out of a thousand instead of one out of 100. Does that meaningfully change the way we feel for most people? It doesn't. They have no concept of whatever. What if I decrease. What if I cut the number of innocent black people killed by 90%? What if I say instead of a thousand black people killed, it was 100 black people killed? Right. Or ten? Right. Even when you change the numbers significantly by 90% or increase them by 900%, by 1000%. It doesn't actually moderate or impact the way people feel about a particular thing at all, which is problematic. It shows that you're not engaging a critical part of your brain, but rather you're going by, like, you're too narratively driven and your feelings aren't reflecting any kind of, like, facts on the ground. They're reflecting, like, a narrative that's a little bit detached from reality, more detached than it should be.\n",

He should have some kind of ratio in mind if he thinks that this one is bad. Otherwise, if you think this one's bad, but you don't even know what good would be.

      "Destiny: American assault, what is good for you? In my personal opinion, it depends on the debate that I'm preparing for. If I was preparing for a debate on stage with a bunch of retards, which most people are, I actually don't have a good one in mind right now because the one that I used to use, I don't even know if it's right, there was one that said that 90% of killed people in combat were civilians. So nine to one was one that I've used in the past, but that one is often cited and it comes from a UN press release. But that UN press release, I don't think bases that number on anything. So instead, I've seen people that break down and it goes, and, yeah, that's a wild UN statement. It's probably not true or the truth. Part of that is it's like 90% of huge conflicts are civilian casualies as it goes into a whole other shit. I've seen people that will go into civilian to military deaths in certain battles or in micro conflicts. So, like, they'll say, like, the battle of Fallujah had this. That's probably more appropriate to compare to the entire war, like, in Gaza right now, because it's all, like, heavily urbanized conflict. Yeah. So if I'm having a good faith discussion with somebody, truly, you're never really going by ratios. You're going by the apparent conduct and the pattern of attacks. That's probably what you should be going by. Right? Is there a pattern of behavior that makes us feel as though Israel is indiscriminately targeting civilian deaths? Like, if you start to see, like, building after building of, like, hundreds of civilians just being slaughtered, and it seems like there's no military deaths being posted by the IDF, you know, then this is costuse per concern. But then obviously for this conflict, it. It's even more difficult because Hamas doesn't fight in uniforms. The Hamas medical people don't ever post military deaths. So now we're only relying on the IDF side. And it's notoriously difficult to figure out what an acceptable range of deaths should even be. I think. Yeah.\n",

People use this weird, like, death rate by day. Like it means anything. Like, it's just kind of weird and dumb. Yeah. I don't know, like, measuring like this. Many people have died per day because the. So if this conflict were have draw out for ten years and nobody else were to die, all of a sudden, the conflict would be way better because the casualty rate would decrease. It's just stupid, I think. Yeah. I mean, how is Israel doing compared to the average would be the question, I'd think. Maybe. But the problem with Israel and Palestine is that it is truly a conflict that's beyond comparison. I don't think that this region maps on cleanly to any conflict in any other part of human history. So it's hard to compare, you know? Like. Yeah, it's just hard. It's hard to compare. You're fighting a non standard military that's still actually like the administrator to a region. You're fighting heavily urban conflict for the entirety of the conflict. It's not like you're moving from city to city. It's all one city, basically. It's all just a giant city. You're dealing with an enemy that isn'trying to induce as many civilian deaths as possible. You're dealing with an unprecedented amount of microscopic analysis and criticism. Like, it's just everything about this conflict makes it so that it doesn't matter. It's almost just analogous to every other type of conflict on the planet. It's just very, very, very difficult. Yeah. Anytime people start making comparisons. I don't think it's bad to make comparisons, but you absolutely need to understand the limitations of those comparisons when you're making them. Ye.\n",

I would say that the best way to analyze it is probably going by, like, how many hamas militants do we think there are? How many civilians do we think there are? And then measure the approximate deaths of each, and then start to figure out a ratio of, like, are we killing an appropriate number of things or not? Or how discriminate indiscriminately our bombing is. But that's gonna require you to measure even that. There's gonna be subjectivity to that. Cause I don't even know how you would compare that to other conflicts. For instance, let's say that I think there's a country of 10 million people and there's 100 militants in that entire country. Let's say that I do a bombing and I kill 100 militants and 1000 people. Right? Well, that's a one to ten death ratio, which is pretty high. But there's, like, what did I say? 10 million people in the country and only 100. You killed every single militant in one strike, but you also got a thousand. Like, that'd probably be an okay strike. Right. You got every single militant in this attack, but you also got. Right, but let's say that you've got a country of 1 million people with 200,000 soldiers, and then that same attack happens where you kill 100 soldiers and a thousand civilians. There are so many militants in this country. Not as many air civilians as a percentage. How did you kill so many civilians with one strike? The numbers there, even. Even if it was the exact same numbers, because of the ratio of military participants to civilians and the other end, it would make that attack feel different. But. But, yeah, like, truly, it's. You're in. Like, you're in very subjective worlds here, trying to compare these numbers around y you.\n",

Now, if anyone saw the videos that the israeli embassy was putting out and not releasing to everybody, for obvious reasons, I mean, you see a moment of a father being killed in front of his.\n",

      "Destiny: What apparenly, apparently Israel created a video showcasing everything that happened on October 7 that I think is 47 minutes long or 40 minutes long that they only showed to members of the Knesset and then some people in the media. But it's not publicly available to you anywhere. I don't know why it's not publicly available to you, because Israel hates doing any kind of positive propaganda for themselves. But I think maybe the members of the families didn't want it to go public or whatever. But yeah, I want other world leaders.\n",

In say that Hamas is very clear in its charter and in its revised charter, which is no better, that it is a 7th century cult that is bent on destroying the jewish nation. Now, if we want to say up here that we're okay with that, that we're ok with Israel being destroyed, a member nation of the United nations ratified in 1948, we can talk about how this happened, et cetera, but Hamas wants it gone. That's what we're talking about. We're talking about a war against a group of people, let's be generous and call them a group of people that have an eliminationist ideology, to borrow from Daniel Goldhagen. It is an eliminationist ideology. They do not lie about. When they tell you what they believe, believe them. It is clearly a just war.

So we should look at the five, six previous skirmishes or wars or rocket wars, whatever you want to call them, and ask the question, why didn't Israel finish off Hamas? They haven't changed. And the reason is because they understood that Hamas fights in such a despicable way as to maximize the civilian casualties on their own side. We all know, we've heard this before, that they will launch rockets from schools and mosques and so forth. But there was always was known to the Israelis, in fact, it was known to human rights organizations, it was known to news agencies for many years that the headquarters of Hamas s Qassum brigades, their military wing, was under the largest hospital in Gaza. Who does such a thing?\n",

If so, I haven't heard that claim before. I know al Shifa was used commonly in Amnesty International, I think I said as much. And Human Rights Watch, I believe. Wait, let me make sure I'm getting these right. Authorities allowed the family to view the body, the body on February 7 and again on February 8. Relatives said they asked the government run chiefa hospital to perform an autopsy, but their requests were refused because they had no authorization from Hamas. Nice. Okay. I don't know if they'll talk about it here. I think it was. This is the report we read by Im'going to see international that talks about how even back in 2014, I think even before this, people knew that al Shiva hospital was used by Hamas. But.\n",

      "D: Less. There is a deliberate strategy to both maximize civilian casualties on your adversary side, as well as the people you purport to govern. Now, the atrocities committed on October 7 were just so inhumane and so barbaric and savage that it left Israel no choice but to confront this dilemma that had been dealing with for the past 17 years. It has to destroy this organization, despite the fact that it has spent nearly two decades building up an infrastructure, I might add, with aid, provided they were supposed to go to the people of Gaza to build an entire underground city just for its fighters and commanders so that they can be safe as Israel retaliates for the atrocities committed by Hamas. So when you are dealing with such a stark choice, thus there are going to be civilian casualties because the army, the military that is usually supposed to protect those civilian casualties, would rather sacrifice them for a pr victory.\n",

Because what Israel must do in eliminating Hamas is to show to every other dirtbag islamist terrorist group and nation state like Iran that this tactic of fighting wars will not prevail. Because if Hamas survives, then you will better believe that the next wars that are fought by various kinds of fanatical terrorist groups will continue to learn from their tactics. So in my view, it's an easy question. Of course it's a just war.\n",

Neod DeMU thanks for the five GR subs, but it is true that you need to demonstrate to the rest of the world that using human shields and these other forms of asymmetrical warfare that involve inducing death in the civilian population shouldn't be an effective way to do war. You don't want to incentivize people to do that. In my opinion, the international community heavily incentivizes this type of behavior by being way too harsh on the israeli side and not being harsh enough on especially non state actors that take advantage of civilian populations.\n",

So there are still, sadly, Nazis and neo Nazis today, but the Third Reich does not exist. So in answer to your question, you're never maybe going to eliminate these terrible, toxic ideas. Sure. But if you can show that these ideas will not be able to govern a place like Gaza or anywhere in the world, and that their leaders, wherever they are, are not going to be safe, I think that's a very important Det.

      "\n",
      "Destiny: Wow. Somebody in chat found the article on this. This is when the 16 May. Why is the Un Cing lower death toll for women and children? And if you scroll down here they'll tell you here. The figures have been released in different ways by the two separate authorities, the GMO and the health ministry, and the UN has now switched from quoting the former to the latter to break down demographic data. At the start of the war, the health ministry only reported deaths for which details had been registered in hospitals, whereas from November the GMO included an additional category of deaths recorded in reliable media reports. More recently, the health ministry has included these media reports compiled by the GMO, along with an additional category of deaths recorded by family members by filling in an online form. Gaza's health ministry is now therefore reporting these figures. Deaths recorded in hospitals, deaths reported by family members and deaths from reliable media reports. Some of these for which information is missing, such as an id number or date of birth, are included in the overall number of deaths in the health ministry figures, but are not broken down demographically. The number of women and children killed is deeply contested because it is often interpreted as an indication of the number of civilian deaths. The GMO is consistently given a higher figure for the proportion of women and children in all fatalities than has the health ministry. On the 6 May, the union reported 34,735 deaths, of which there were 9500 women and 14,500 children, citing the GMO as its source. Then two days later, the UN released a further report, switching its sourcing to the health minister. The result of this was that although the overall recorded death toll was almost unchanged, 34,144, the number of registered deaths of women, 4959 and children, 7797, had both fallen significantly. So now you see the number of deaths reported by women went from 9500 almost to under 5000, and children went from 14,500 to under 7800. Right. Significant differences in percentages here. This difference was because those individuals with incomplete information were not included in the demographic breakdown. So it's interesting that the deaths that were reported without any really good backing information for them all happened to be, or basically all of them were women and children. That's very, very, very sussy Baca. Very sussy baca. The GMO says the proportion of women and children killed in the conflict is around 70%. The UN's latest report setting health ministry data says out of 24,686 fully identified fatalities, 52% were women and children, 40% were men and 8% were elderly. Without specifying whether they were male or female, it isn't clear what age the report considers to be elderly, and Howard categorized as children. So for the GMO's figure to be compatible with the health ministry's data, almost all of the 10,000 deaths not fully identified by the ministry would have to have been women and children. We asked the GMO why the proportion of women and children they had recorded as killed is so much higher than in the health ministries's data, but they did not provide a direct response to the discrepancy. This is a BBC article as well. So it's not like we're on some crazy pro zionist website. Bute.\n",

      "Destiny: Oh, I bet the other side is go going toa cite. There's a pro palestinian organization. Fuck. What were they called? That do an alternative analysis to this and they reject that. They're the only organization, I believe, that still maintains that it was an errant iron dome rocket. I don't remember the name of that. Somebody will say it in chat, but I bet the lefty people are going to cite that. Oh, forensic architects. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's them. Yeah.\n",

      "C: Yes, it was revised down.\n",
      "\n",
      "E: I am talking and you're not going to talk right now. So I'm not Robbie suave. Sorry. So those numbers, and I'll tell you this, in war, keeping in mind that Dresden, for instance, where I keep seeing this coming up on Twitter, etcetera, the german government determined that the number in Dresden was anywhere from 20 to 30,000 about 15 years ago. I mean, no one ##ing this stuff in real time is very hard. It's nearly impossible to answer that question without having some kind of knowledge. What I can tell you is I don't trust anybody in this. When I was in Ukraine, right after the war started in Ukraine, I was in a bar and they had a thing up. The number of jets shot down, number of Russians killed, and it was wildly inflated. And, you know, I was on the side of the Ukrainians. I didn't want to see them be invaded by these heathen Russians. But I was like, I think they're kind of inflating that. So everyone is doing that. So clinging to these numbers as if.\n",

This has happened in all of the previous conflicts. Israel's estimates, Gaza's estimates in the United States as estimates. They're all in about the same place. So like, you know, talking about. Oh, they're trying to exaggerate the numbers. So they said 500 or whatever. Yeah, they were wrong when they said that. They revised down. And I'm not even ne wrong. I'm not they lying necessly.\n",

I think it still included in the Israeli killed death toll.\n",

And that's where it was a huge story. There are people today, like, if you talk to Hassan, he still doesn't believe that that story was not true. He'll still tell you that, that that bombing was done by Israel.\n",

      "\n",
      "C: Important point. Part of why the Hamas health ministry is very good at tracking the deaths is because, and by the way, Israel is'contesting, apart from for political reasons, took a while for them to start contesting these numbers, because Israel knows where every single person in Gaza lives is. Gaza is under the control of Israel. It is an occupied territory according to international law, and as a consequence, they know the names and ages and addresses of all the people that have been killed. That is why Palestinians have been able to put up slideshows.\n",

If they did, then there would be no tunnels, because they'd know that tunnels are being built constantly in that fucking.\n",

      "C: Place where you can scroll through. It takes about, I think, seven minutes to scroll through the names of just the 13,000 children that have been killed with their ages next to their names. These are real people. And so even if you, you think every adult, including all of the women, were Hamas and deserved to die, I think there's a really important question as to whether or not you. I think the 13,000 children who have been killed, some of whom we've watched, been tracked down and killed by israeli drone cameras, are the adequate consequences, collateral damage for this allegedly just war.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "C: An investigation show that Israel has desecrated 16 cemeteries in Gaza since this conflict started? Okay, Hamas under the cemetery.

      "\n",
      "Destiny: Calling a bomb dumb or not is, is. I don't know why. I don't know if it was jank. I know he did this. In our debate, this talking point of, like, dumb bomb versus smart bomb is largely retarded. Okay? Just because a dumb bomb doesn't have, you know, like, post launch guidance mechanisms. There's better words for this. I don't remember. The terms are when you have secondary. When you got services for navigation after you've launched a weapon, just because you don't have the ability to, like, change their trajectory mid flight doesn't mean that they're just randomly shot into a place. Right? Like a plane can, with a high level of precision, depending on circumstances, depending on their webinaring, like, type of weapon used and what you're hitting. A plane can deliver a bomb with a high, high, high level of precision just because the bomb doesn't have, like, a secondary trajectory changes or whatever. So this obsession over, like, dumb bombs and smart bombs is like, just, just really fucking stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: Like, pound bombs. These are dumb bombs that are not precision. They're cheaper munitions. They're not being used to uncover tunnels, as the PR agents have said, but to kill individual junior level militants in their apartment buildings, okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: It doesn't. People, first of all, just Palestinians don't live like that, okay? Families tend to live in very, very large communities with lots of families living under the same roof. They tend to live pretty close together, number one. Number two, Hamas doesn't operate this way. They're nevernna just be in a room alone. What is this? You're, like, showing a, you're demonstrating a lack of understanding of, like, the culture, the region, and the military tactics. Like, all in one go. Like, what a stupid, like, oh, you need to be individually targeting the guy who's sitting alone in his apartment. I thought you said yourself that this is the most densely populated region in the world. Even ignoring cultural military strategy, like, what are you talking about?\n",
      "\n",
      "F: You kill individual junior level militants in their apartment buildings. Okay? And thus in lines with the rule of engagement, where they can kill 20 civilians to kill a single suspected junior militant, to kill all the civilians who live there. Nearly half of israeli munitions dropped on Gaza or emprecise dumb bombs. So this is terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: A bullet is dumb. Artillery is dumb. Anything without, like, the ability to change the trajectory in air is dumb. That doesn't mean it's not precise. I'm willing to bet I could say this. I'm sure it's true. I'm willing to bet that there are some smart weapons that have worse guidance systems and aiming abilities than some dumb weapons launched from incredibly smart platforms. I bet that's the case. I'm sure there are guided cruise missiles and shit or whatever that, like, when launched and given their ability to maneuver and track targets or whatever, are probably less precise than dumb bombs launched from, like, f 35s that are, you know, have, like, fucking 50 million different, you know, analyses and mathematical equation that are being calculated. Like, guide dumb bombs. Like, it's such a stupid distinction to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: And. Okay, so you can. I hate Hamas. I want to get rid of Hamas. The second thing you need to do is actually resurrect the peace process, because what we've seen at every point in history is thatin when the Palestinians feel that they'don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: You criticize Hamas for using dumb bombs? No, I don't, you retard. I criticize Hamas for using weapons that don't have any aiming whatsoever from the time of launch. The problem with the rockets that come out of the Gaza Strip is they don't have any aiming whatsoever. They're just shot at cities. That's it. Israel's not randomly shooting bombs into the Gaza Strip. If that was the case, there'd be hundreds of thousands of civilians dead, and the ratios would be way different than they are right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: There is a real path towards peace. They moderate, the hatred decreases, and the violence stops. This is how the second have hear, this is second. This is how the second intifada ended. So the second intifada ended with a resurrection of the peace process. Okay. And since the end of the second intifada, Fata has not engaged in what was the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Wait, what is he referring to? What was the peace process that ended the second intifada? I thought the second intifada basically ended with unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip. When did Annapolis start? But those talks didn't even. Was that 2007 or 2006? Was 2007. End of 2007. The Annapolis peace thing is what led to Ulmer in 2008, making it offer to a boss second intifada. What was what peace process ended the second intifada in 2005. Many consider the Sharm El Sheikh summit of 2005 to have ended the uprising as President Mahmouda boss and israeli prime minister agreed to take definitive steps to de ecalate the hostilities. Nothing really happened. There was no, like, actual, like, agreements were tour. I think it was both of them were probably just saying, yeah, they reaffirmed their commitment to the roadmap for peace that had been proposed in 2003. Oh, and Sharon released some prisoners. I don't think there was a, like, there were no real peace talks that happened after 2005. Not that I'm aware of. May maybe m, you know, I keep sayinging maybe I'm miss something.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: I did miss violent terrorism. Okay, so there's the not end of the peace process. Okay. And since the end of the second intif Fada, Fata has not engaged in, you know, violent terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Whying why are we bring it fataah here? We're talking about Hamas. What do they have to do with anything? I don't understand what the, okay, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: So there's that. And then there was also the Oslo accords in the nineties, which ended when the peace process didn't feel like it was working towards anything that was going to be successful. Because Clinton required to Arafat that he waive the right of return, not limit the right of return. I'm talking about Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from their home, expelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Okay, that's not true. When they ask for the right of return, they're not only asking about people that were expelled in 48. They're also talking about all of their descendants, married, family and everything as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: Benny Morris counts 24 massacres that happened in Palestine, and these include areas where at least 150,000 were pure expulsion in the Nakba oay of a total of 750,000, and then many, many others who fled in fear and all sorts of other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: But, ooh, careful. Benny Morris would actually say that more. I think you would say more than 102,000 were expelled. That what he just gave there is a zionist talking point. I don't even know how much he's aware of anything. He just like he quietly admitted that the vast majority of the Nakba were not expelled from their towns, but they just fled. They just ran away. That's a zionist talking point. I believe that most pro Palestinians are going to argue sourcing Benny Morris'works, that the majority of them, over five or 600,000 of the Palestinians that fled their villages in 48, were doing so in response to military pressure or attacks on their cities or villages. The fact that he just said that, like, 600,000 just ran because they were afraid, that's like a really big. But I don't know who the knows anything about their time right here. But that was just funny that you.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: Just said that large portion was actively expelled. And there are palestinian refugees that are still actually alive from back then. That can point to you exactly where their home was. They can point to you exactly where their home was, or their children are alive or their grandchild children are alive. And they can point ex exactly to where their family's home was. Homes that often those families lived on for generations. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: That was probably not out of true, but maybe. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "F: And that land was expropriated after the war and given to jewish owners. Gold de year lived in a house that was stolen from a palestinian christian and given to her. Okay.\n",

      "\n",

      "C: I think you're right. I think Jake's right that it's really important to answer the question of what Palestinians want to answer the question of what Israel should do in the wake of October 7. And I think pointing to the fact that, what is it, like, half the population of Gaza today are children. The actual people are the descendants of the 700,000 who were purged, ethnically cleansed from the land that is now called Israel and the NBaH. So I'm sure many of you can imagine from the actual people or the descendants of the 700,000 who were purged, ethnically cleansed from the land that is now called Israel and the Nakba. So I'm sure many of you can imagine what you would do in that sort of a scenario if when your grandparents were young and your parents were their children in their house, they had been chasing out of wherever you live at 13 Pine Drive or whatever, and you were forced to move a state over in a refugee camp that's constructively what Gaza is. It's a refugee population of 2.3 million people. And you can look over there, you are close enough, you know, you can Google Maps if you have Google.\n",

God, I want to do one of these debates from the pro palestinian side so bad. It's just like's just all dogshit. This is all stupid. It's just stupid emotional. But I mean, I say stupid, but I mean, it works. People like emotional points. She's popular, she has a big podcast.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny: Yeah. Welcome to the end of world War two. There are tons of people been expelled from homes that have given up the right to go back to any of those places. That has happened in lots of places in the world.\n",

Joe Biden is now spending your tax dollars building a port in Israel, in Gaza, rather because Gaza isn't allowed to have those kinds of infrastructure, basic infrastructure projects on its own.

      "\n",
      "B: Not being about it. One of the biggest arguments about October 7 is that what do you expect the pressed people to do? If you're living in the situation that Brianna and Jac are describing, if your family'been moved from their homes, if they see daily violence, all of this stuff is going on, what do you expect those people to do? Now? I.\n",

      "\n",
      "D: Well, I mean, to answer your question, if you go back to 1936, the first time that the SHU, before there was a jewish state, responded to the Peel commission, was to accept partition of the land. The response from the Arabs, what's known as the arab riots, which were quite destructive. Move forward a little bit more to 1947. There's a UN partition plan. Guess what? David Ben Gurion and the Yeshu before there's a state of Israel accepts it. The Arabs do not 48. They declare independence, but only in the area that was allotted by the partition. But not only did the Palestinians declare war, but so did every other Arab stay for the most part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Technically the palestinian israeli war happened before the declaration of Independence, number one. And number two, technically Israel ultimately ended up expanding outside of the borders of the fortyate partition. They took a little bit more land, but was minor quebles.\n",

I don't know who this guy is. It's like dumb and dumber for these debates. They could have at least paired it with somebody that had some understanding of at least like some of the rough facts. But I guess this is the best that this side can do for these debates. Spent destiny. He said Israel declared independence in the britdishian territories of 48. I don't remember Israel declaring any territory in 48. You can link me that or you can show me that, but I don't remember them declaring any territory. I just remember them declaring independence and then the territory that they ended up going for was about the partition planned area and then a little bit further outside of those bounds. But maybe they did declare exact territory. But I don't remember that.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny: So the answer isn't just that Nasser deployed troops along the Sinai. The deployment of those troops followed the expulsion of the UN peacekeeping force that was put thereafter. Eli didn't mention the war in 56, that after the Suez crisis in 56, the UN had their own peacekeeping troops that were along the Sinai to make sure that there wouldn't be conflict between the two states. And Egypt expelled those troops before deploying their own army along the Sinai. They didn't just deploy troops, they expelled peacekeeping troops first.\n",

      "\n",
      "D: The first response from Israel was Algh, let's negotiate. And then they were greeted with what is known as a three no's. Now, fortunately, better leadership did come along. There was another war in 1973, we all know, and the Egyptians made peace and event, the Jordanians made peace, and other arab states have largely gotten out of the maybe we can just destroy Israel business. The last stand here of the people who are still rejecting any possible partition are the Palestinians. And the Palestinians continue to start wars which they hope will eliminate Israel, lose those wars, and then say, oh my, we're the victims. I want to go back to 1940 819 48, again, was not a war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: This is kind of a one sided telling of history, but it's like, it's mostly kind of correct, a little one sided, but mostly correct, that the jewish state started.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: It was a war that the jewish state finished as part of its independence. Now, there were all kinds of population movements and transfers throughout the 1940s, as.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: We all know, there was the, yeah, greek and Turkey was a huge one. India and Pakistan was a huge one. After World War two, there were tons of Germans expelled from all sorts of european states. I feel like I read the number of, that was like 15 or 16 million people. Is that true? Germans expelled Europe after World War two? That seems like way too big a number. Some 14 million Germans fled or rejected from what? A city's Poland, Russia, the Czec Republic, Hungary, Baltic state. Okay, so, yeah, from 44 to 48, at least 12 million Germans were expelled from eastern Europe and resettled. Okay. Damn. So it was a huge, huge, huge number, hu.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: But the only group of people that has its own special UN organization to basically treat the great grandchildren of original refugees as if they have this so called right of return are the Palestinians. We don't hear anything about Kashmiris wanting to go to India or various ethnic Germans wanting to go back to their homes in Poland or any number of things. Millions of people in this period, the only people we care about is the Palestinians.\n",

      "B: So what should they do? What should Palestinians do in stop starting wars with.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: With Israel and losing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: If they had good history on the other side, you say, stop starting wars and losing. Then they would say, oh, well, what started the Oslo accords? Oslo one was a response to Oslo one was a response to the first intifada, the stone intifada. We didn't even get the palestinian authority recognition of a state until we actually had. Until we actually had, you know, a violent uprising to force Israel to pay attention to us. You know, the recognition of the PLO or Palestinians as a state arguably follows, you know, from the seventies and onwards, like PLO terrorism or, you know, offers made. I'm trying to think. I don't know. Would Palestinians say it was a success for disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005? Maybe, maybe not. But yeah, I mean, you can argue that violence is ultimately what gets them attention, which is true, which is a huge fault from Israel. You know, why, like on October 7, now we're talking about peace again, whereas before it was the Abraham accords that also ignored all of the Palestinians. Right. Abraham accords completely igored them. Well, now we're talking about peace again because violence happened. The reason why, and I see this brought up in chat a lot, why is it that the Palestinians support Hamas? Why did the Palestinians supports. The reason why Palestinians support Hamas is because when Hamas does shit, people start talking about what should happen. That's why Hamas has support. Palestinians view the PA as a toothless entity that's not going to further their cause towards, like, any final state. They just. They don't feel that way. They feel like the palestinian authorityities is involved in maintaining the status quo, in serving israeli interests, and basically being a buffer between the Palestinians and any final peaceful solution. That's why they generally will support Hamas. Maybe they don't necessarily like terrorism. Maybe they don't necessarily like women being raped or children being killed. But at least Hamas is like moving the conversation forward. It that's why Palestinians generally support Hamas over the PA.\n",
      "\n",
      "B: But what about, I think it's a fair point that they're not living in the best conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: Let no, they're notiving in the best conditions. And by the way, there have been gazillions of dollars of international development aid to Gaza. But guess what? It's stolen by their horrific and terrible leaders. And it's not just ha mo that true. Who are these fanatic dirtbags? Which we all know what they did on October 7. It's also the Palestinian Authority. They are so incredibly corrupt, they pocketed for themselves. And the only way that they are able to constantly kind of hold on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: To power, the poor PA. Everybody hates the PA. Palestinians hate the PA. The PA hates the PA. People h other parties in the po hate the PA, and Hamas hates the PA. Obviously, Israelis hate the PA. Everybody just seems.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: To hate the PA is by poisoning the minds of their population and making them think that they can destroy a thriving jewish state that's there when Israel has in Oslo under Ahihud Olmar. And I'm telling you, if there was a palestinian leader that said, okay, let's do it, let's do the partition, I guarantee you the Israelis would be fine with it and we could get it done. But that's the problem. The problem is the Palestinians still want it all and they just have to let it go. It's a dangerous ilus in way, though, not a boss.\n",

      "F: Way is that not a boss?\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Oh, in what way is that not a boss? Well, then the direct response is what? Why did a boss say no to Umert's peace offering in 2008? That's the direct response to that. I've never heard a good reason given.\n",
      "\n",

      "C: Netanyahu was caught delivering two cases of cash to Hamas. He's so invested in funding Hamas and Hamas being in power in Gaza and the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: That's such a. So Netanyahu was willing to allow money to continue to flow into the Gaza Strip. That was coming from Qatar. But whether or not that was good or bad is a more detailed conversation than just Netanyahu was creating or supporting Hamas. That's a very reductive way of viewing that relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The reason is Israel needs to be able to rely on the argument that the political power that Palestinians have is so radical, is so right wing and so hateful, that there cannot be no negotiation. So he has worked to undermine the Palestinian Authority. He worked to undermine more moderate politicians that Palestinians have nominated over the years, have put forward over the years. And as early as this past week as the international criminal courts has looked into issuing warrants for Israelis who have committed war crimes, what has been his response? His response has been to threaten not Hamas or anything going on in Gaza, but to threaten to do more war crimes in the West bank if he or any other members of his administration are charged with any of these ICC warrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: I don't even know what she was referring to here. Probably some unhinged statement he made, maybe. I'm not even sure she was s referring to there.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: But there has been a repeated effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Also, the ICC has also issued warrants for. Did they issue these or were they asking for these? I think they were request. No, no, these are the warrants that were requested. They haven't been issued yet, but they were requesting warrants also for Han, the head of the, its S Politburo, right, for Hamas, basically the leader of Hamas S. It was Sinwar who was considered the leader of the Gaza Strip, and it was. Is it Mohammad Deif, who is the l? Was he. Is he the military leader of the al custom brigades? Hold on, I need to remember these name. Is it oa brigades? Yes. Okay. I wonder, do they mention it all on the. She mentions one set of. And also the only reason the ICC has jurisdiction is because the Palestinians wanted the ICC have jurisdiction. So it's extra funny the if Hamas leadership doesn't submit themselves to the ICC, but then expects israeli leaders too, but.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: To punish the most moderate Palestinians because otherwise he would be forced to make a case for why he doesn't think that people who are literally from what is now described as Israel cannot return home. And the real reason why they cannot allow people have the right to return is because there's a commitment to it being not just a pluralistic state like the one we live in''re very proud of having people from all over the world who found freedom from religious persecution. And you can live how ever you want to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: To be clear, in the United States we do not allow unlimited immigration by any group of people. That is not true. Immigration is capped in total 7% from any individual country per year. We would never allow in the United States 150 million people from another country to come here and immigrate at one point in time. That's not you. Even for us immigration policy, we would.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Never agree to that and practice whatever religion you want to practice that. They specifically want it to be a jewish ethno state. And if you were to allow the approximately 5 million or so Palestinians that live in the West bank and in Gaza to be a part of contiguous Israel, they would lose a religious majority and lose the ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: They don't care about the religious majority. They care about the ethnic majority because of the ethnic protections. That's what they care about. It's the ethnic part that's important there, not necessarily any religious thing.\n",

      "\n",
      "B: Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: The jewish ethno state doesn't really apply when you talk about an ethnoate generally they're talking about a country that doles out different rights to different ethnic groups. Controlling your immigration and deciding who you allowed to come to the country isn't necessarily along the Symb as an ethnoate. The Palestinians that live in Israel more or less of the same legal rights as the jewish people that live in Israel or the different groups of Jews or other types of Bedwin, Drewz or whatever generally have the same legal rights and protections. That's why in the Knesset, you've got palestinian elected people. That's why you've got, I think there's an islamist party that is one member that's seated in the Knesset right now to call it an ethno state because of their immigration policies. It doesn't map on very cleanly. Again, it's trying to project, like, a western understanding of the world onto a country that it doesn't really work right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: Can I respond to that? I very close. I don't remember Netanyahu's we promise to do war crimes in the West bank speech, but.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: O hi, what's up? Yeah, I just wanted to add to this. A lot of people will criticize Israel for, like, its immigration policies and shit or border walls and all this kind of crap. Like, I mean, so many other developed nations have a lot of these same practices. If you look at Quebec in Canada, a lot of white nationalist neo Nazis actually use Quebec as an example of how Canada as a whole should handle immigration, because Quebec has a special protected class in Canada where it's its most important minority. And they actually allow Quebec to not allow immigrants from certain countries to come in. So they can actually deny people coming in from, like, Africa, for instance, if they want to, on that basis alone, just so that they can protect their, like, cultural identity and keep most of the province french. So if you're go goingna criticize Israel for doing some of these things, like not allowing people to immigrate and from certain muslim nations, I mean, are they gonna claim that Canada, Quebec specifically isn an apartheid state kind of retarded? No. All right. All right. Thank you. Just wanted to add that. And you should feed your cats vegan. Gotcha. But take care. Bye. Somebody said almost no Arab Israelis identify as palestinian at all. Only 7% Arab Israelis are not the Palestinians. The reason why I use this term now is because my understanding is completely the opposite of that. I mean, I didn't talk to every single person in Israel, but my understanding is the vast majority of them consider themselves Palestinians that have israeli citizenship in Israel. So that's why I've been using the term Palestinian Israelis instead of Arab Israelis. I think the vast majority of them consider themselves be Palestinians in terms of ethnicity and then Israelis in terms of citizenship. But.\n",

      "\n",
      "D: Yahoo. We promised to do war crimes in the West bank speech, but. Okay, we'gole. You just said it. Fiana, you just said he promised to do more work crimemes to the West bank. I'm just basically quoting you back to you. Anyway, more importantly, I wanted to say there was. Netanyahu did not deliver suitcases full of cash. He arranged for the Qataris to give development aid to Hamas because no one in Europe, for good reason, no one in America for good reason wanted to actually have the, you know, dirty up their hands by giving various kinds of money to a humanitarian group. But given the fact that they were the sovereigns of Gaza, someone needed to provide for basic infrastructure. Un, that's what happened. That, that' that's what happened. It wasn't Netanya.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: That's. Eli is more correct than. He's more correct than she is. But again, this is kind of a one telling. It is true. Netanyahu didn't want to see the entire Gaza Strip become completely defineded who have fall into chaos, although essentially that's what happened. But I mean, Netyau also did see advantages in terms of keeping Hamas poised against the PA as well. So it's kind of like a dual purpose thing. Eli is s only telling one side of that story there.

      "Destiny: Pa, plo active in Gaza at that point. No. So the even asking people in Israel to explain this is complicated. Okay. You have something called the PLO. And the PLO is basically a big conglomerate of different palestinian parties. Under the PLO. You've got, the big boy here is Fata or Feta. This is like your largest party of the PLL. You've also got other parties as well, like the DFLP. The PFLP, this is like the Palestinian PFP. The DFLP is the democratic front for the Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP is the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine, I think. And there are other smaller parties are under the PLO. Then you've got another thing called the PA. The PA is the Palestinian Authority. This is the governing body that was the administrative body that was created by Israel in the Oslo accords that governs Palestine. It was supposed to be all of Palestine, but right now it's just the. Oh, the Popular Front, maybe. Sorry, but not right. But it's just the West bank right now. Right. So ideally, Hamas was supposed to be part of Hamas, and Islamic Jihad are supposed to be part of like the PLO. But I think right now, the PA, I believe it's only basically controlled by people from Fetah. It's not controlled by the PLO. I think so the PA is like an administrative thing that does, like policing insecur and pays people to work in the government or whatever for the West Bank, Fata is the largest party under the PLO. So people will kind of use these interchangeably. The PLO or Fatah, although the PLO contains other parties. And then Hamas and islamic jihad. Palestinian islamic jihad are the two big parties in the Gaza Strip. Okay, so how is allowing the aid from Qatar to go to Gaza supporting Hamas against the PLO? Well, because technically the PLO, or the Palestinian Authority more specifically, should have administrative control over the Gaza Strip. Hamas shouldn't. It should be the PA. And as long as Hamas remains strong, Hamas stands in opposition. Hamas and Palestinian Islam jihad. As long as these two parties are strong, these parties stand in opposition to Fatah and the PLO. This is why they'll push for it. They say, oh, well, we want elections. We want there to be new elections. And Makmoud Abbas, who is the president of the. No, he's the chairman of Fe. No, he's the chairman of the PLO. A boss is, I believe. Let me double check real quick. I think is of. Let me check. Yes, he's the chairman of the PLO and he's the president of the PA. When people say Palestinian National Authority, that's the same thing as PA. Pnapa is the same thing. But the Hamas thinks that if they hold elections again, that they'll win and that they can be. They'll either be like the new chairman, people of the PLO, and then they get to run the PA in. Yeah, but. Okay, what caused Gaza to split from PH jurisdiction? My history is a little rough around the edges here, but I believe in 2005, I believe that elections were held. No, 2007 elections were held. And because of the way the elections were done, Hamas ends up winning a majority of the seats for the Palestinian Liberation organization. They have a majority of the seats in the PLO. And Hamas had a history of violence, and neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians nor the Americans liked that. So Fataah was looking for ways around Hamas control in the Gaza Strip. Hamas basically ends up kind of realizing this, and then they basically coup and start killing and throwing out all the competing parties in the Gaza Strip. And then they are basically two separate entities from that point forward. The PLO and the PA basically only exists over in the West bank now. And then Hamas and Islamic Jihad are the, the two big parties in the Gaza Strip, and theyre basically separated at this point. But o what caused Gaza to split? Is Hamas turned, is Hamas turned to the PA and the ploicians, involuntary bungee jumpers from o okays.\n",

It's a translated article, I think, from Hertz that's talking about a leaked conversation where Netanyahu is talking to other Likud party members about him, basically bragging about keeping Hamas strong and undermining the actually, we can just find this Netanyahu Hart's quote, likud party meeting. I'm notnna be able to find this full can, does anybody have a link to this article? I don't think I saved it because this is before we started using obsidian. Can I find the full story I originally read? It was a translated from Hebrew. You can. I wish I could find a larger part. But you can even tell that in reading this that it's not quite like, oh, we just want to prop up Hamas. That's like an added benefit. But you can read, I mean, even reading this, right. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel's regular allowing of Kari funds to be transferred into Gaza, saying it'part of a broader strategy to keep Hamas and the palestinian authorities separate. A source in Monday's Likud faction meeting said Netanyahu explained that in the past, the PA transferred the millions of dollars to Hamas in Gaza. He argued that it was better for Israel to serve as the pipeline to ensure the funds don't go to terrorism. Now that we are supervising, we know it's going to humanitarian causes, the source said, paraphrasing Netanyahu, the prime minister also said that whoever is against a palestinian state should be for transferring the funds to Gaza because maintaining a separation between the PA in the West bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a palestinian state. Netanyasu also spoke. Netanyahu also spoke about his Barh Ilan speech, in which he expressed support for a demilitarized palestinian state a decade ago. In addition, he told the Likud candidates and the faction meeting that he opposes any population transfers of Jews or Arabs and that he's against uprooting even one person. He said that he had voted for the 2005 Gaza disengagement at first because it was only about territory, but when the discussions moved to moving thousands of people, he resigned from the government party leaders across the politicalructure of criticizing y his policies towards Gaza general payment and the payment specifically. But anyway, I mean, you can see that it was more complicated than just like him funding Hamas to keep them up. Like, there's a lot of other things, there's like a lot of considerations at the time for this. O God, I'm trying to remember what. That there was a full. There was a site that posted a lot of like, I don't think we have the transcript directly from the speech unless it was a separate speech given about it, but I remember the site was in Hebrew. You to translate it. Yeah, whatever. Me. But I mean, whatever. Even in this you can see that it's a little more complicated than it's. Than just him fundingmas carrying the briefcases himselves.\n",

This is why I would debate so many people who just want to give me quotes. You can't debate quotes. You can't even really debate full speeches because there's more than that. But at the very least, give me the full speech. Don't. I'm not saying he has to read the full speech, but you should know what's contained in it because what comes before and after these statements? Like, well, he doesn't just want Gaza to fall apart and then descendd into chaos and then have to give it back to the PA after going in and cleaning it out himself. There's a whole methodology. Now, you can agree or dis ##ree but it's not just as simple as these two sentences that people always quote from this Likud party meeting.\n",

If that's all you're taking from this, that you're missing the whole. Everything that I'm talking about'saying makes it better or worse. I'm just saying that there was more involved in this statement. I believe from what I remember from reading it, the context was essentially that the Gaza Strip was going to fall apart. There was like the amount of aid going in wasn't enough. The Palestinian Authority, don't believe, wanted to transfer money to the Gaza Strip. Qatar was the only one that seemed to want to fund the administration in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu didn't want the Gaza Strip to become poor, to fall into chaos, and then to collapse in a way that the israeli military would have to go in, clean it all up, and then once it was cleaned up, handed back to Mahmoud Ab boss on a silver platter saying, okay, well, here you go. We did all the work and now we've made this palatable for you to control again. So Netanyahu says, well, Qatar should be allowed to have money come in here. They'll fund it. We know that it's going to Hamas. We know that it's going to the Palestin, to the gazan health ministry, whatever like these people like. But they're gonna maintain stability in that region. And it helps because it also keeps the Palestinians divided amongst themselves. It means that Hamas and islamic jihad are going to be powerful administrators in Gaza that will be stable and not collapsing because they're broke. And the Palestinian Authority will exist in the West bank with the PLO. So it also. So if you are opposed, especially if he's trying to sell this to his party, right. If you are opposed to the existence of a palestinian state, you should absolutely support the transfer of Qataari funds into the Gaza Strip. Cause, look, it keeps Hamas strong and it keeps them as min administrators and it keeps them opposed to the Palestinian Authority. Right. It's like a byproduct, essentially, of what's going on here, which I think is probably something that they want. But again, it's not just we should fund Hamas, we should fund the terrorists. It's not just that. It's more complicated. And also, by the way, this'backfired because now he's had to do exactly what he said he didn't want to have to do.\n",

What if they say, no, no external money is going to flow into the Gaza Strip? We're just going to let Hamas basically starve out and we're going to let them have no money? Then the whole world, we saying, oh, collective punishment. Oh, you're starving Palestinians. Oh, you're depriving them of food and humanitarian supplies. Oh, like, look at the horrible things you're causing these people to suffer through. Right? No, it's a lose lose.

And, you know, this is the weird conversation that we're having when people talk about Zionism these days. Credible to me that I'm like, I thought this was a settled matter.

Therefore, no, I'm opposed to Zionism. I don't think that was ever right.

And Benny Morris's book is far more nuanced than that is allowing that there were people who were expelled, there were people that were forced to by their own side, et cetera. Benny Morris and Betny Mors has actually said this, and you quoted him. So let me go to him that if you do have right of return, which, by the way, 7 million people doesn't mean 7 million people that go to the West bank and Gaza.\n",

No, the majority of Palestinians in Jordan are considered refugees even though they have palestinian citizenship. No, no jordanian citizenship. So there are people who have citizenship in the country of Jordan who are also still considered refugees. Also the majority of people in Gaza, and I don't know the percentage, people in the West bank are considered refugees even though they're in Palestine. They're considered palestinian refugees in Palestine, but it's because they're not back in Israel in their original homes. No other refugee in the history of the planet has had that treatment.

As Eli points out, MaHmoud AbASss and the PA have been as corrupt as you can be. You can see that with SuHA ArafaTs lifestyle in Paris, they've been stealing money for years. So that's their fault in some ways, too. But the popularity of Hamas, and again, we have to be very simple about this. And, you know, cite this, but in its charter, which is just saying, hey, guys, this is explicitly what we believe, which was said, by the way, the other day there was a quote from one of these Hamas spokesmen and they said, no, we don't believe that we will never have a two state solution with Israelis. Israel must go. That is a non negotiable position.

The answer is Palestinians need a positive ethos, something to build their country towards and something to aspire to, instead of the negative ethos of just israeli resistance and fighting to reclaim lost honor.

And I want to talk about the United States as an analogy. So, you know, in this country, we did terrible things to the Native Americans. And it was horrif. And, you know, what we did in time was, you know, after World War two, we gave billions of dollars in reparations to the Native Americans. We realized we were able to accept that we had done bad things, and we also gave native american citizenship, okay, which they hadn't had for much of american history. That's the right way to deal with something like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: These types of answers are instantly disqualifying. N if there were 500 million Native Americans, we probably wouldn't have given them citizenship. Native Americans never represented, like an existential demographic threat or an existential threat, period, to the United States. It's way, way, way different. If there were only 150,000 Palestinians, Israel would probably just give them citizenship and move on with it. That's not the issue. Right. Can you explain your logic for why Islam is not the central quad of policy andian behavior? You keep saying this, but you never provide an actual explanation. Which group around the world blows themselves up around civilians. I mean, the Japanese used kamikazi pilots to crash into United States ships during the battles over the Pacific. The reason why Islam is not the general defining thing that's uniting people against Israelis can be seen in the fact that despite all the calls for global jihad, despite Hamas begging over and over again for Muslims to rise up and help the Palestinians, it doesn't happen. There is no united muslim world that is trying to engage in jihad against Israel. It's Hamas screaming over and over again, global jihad. It's Israel. And then people in the west saying, oh, my God, global jihad. And the globe just happens to be Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas, which are, by the way, even part of theoretically opposed sect of Islam. Right. You've got, you know, Islam is part of the Shia sect of whatever. Fuck. I think it's more specific than just Shia. And Hamas are considered themselves Sunnis. Yeah. If you look at the countries most heavily involved in fighting against Israel, it's not the most muslim countries. It's not the heaviest islamic countries. It's geographically the closest country. It's Jordan, Egypt and Syria and Lebanon, I guess, or the southern part of it, at least. When you look at the people that intercepted missiles when they came from Iran, it wasn't just western countries, it was heavy muslim countries. It was Saudi Arabia, it was Jordan. When you look at the coup in 2011 in Egypt and you saw the Muslim Brotherhood come into power, they didn't jihad against Israel. They honored the peace agreement, they honored the treaty that they had with him. One of the leaders literally wrote a letter to the current president of Israel saying as much. They would honor agreement. So no people can scream over and over again about Islam. Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam. 20% of the jewish. 20% of the israeli population are Palestinians. Majority of them are Muslim. They didn't do a third intifada. They don't do a ton of fucking terrorist attacks. There's just. You can scream about it and you can argue about it and you can look like sentences and words, but that analysis is boring. It doesn't explain, it's not explanatory for any part of the history of the region. It's not even explanatory for the current events that happened today. So to me, it's just largely fucking boring.

      "Destiny: Fuck. I read a book recently called U Conflict. I think it was conflict and culture in the Middle east. This desire to. Let me just read a quote out of this. I'm so sorry. Hold on. Give me. Hold on. Chill. God, that statement is so f. Stupid. Meow. What? I have to use the Kindle app to open it. Are you serious? What's up? How you doing? Why are you freaking out? I'm gonna read you, like, three or four paragraphs, okay? It's not that long. Get fucked. The remarkable development of Islam the 7th century CE must be understood to a degree within the context of arabian balanced opposition. So in this book, he talks a lot about a concept called balanced opposition, where part of the ways that society developed in the Middle east was that single people would fight single people, families, families, tribes would fight tribes. That balanced opposition works to make it so that there's, there's like an equilibrium of power that is basically existing through these regions because of like nested sets of groups of people, essentially, without getting into that. But to a degree, within the context of arabian balanced opposition, Islam provided in the Uma, the community of Muslims, a more inclusive level of integration than tribal organization. But at the same time, it also provided an opponent to the Uma, the world of infidels, which had to be confronted for the glory of God and for the prophet of plunder deemed as already belonging to Muslims. Islam, whatever its many dimensions and complexities, were incorporated the balanced opposition structure of the tribal society which it overlay. Perhaps it could hardly have done otherwise and been accepted as it was. The thesis of this book is that balanced opposition is a dominant theme in arab culture and a central structure in arab society. Furthermore, as I shall argue shortly, balanced opposition shapes other aspects of social life and, like all structures, limits the possibilities in this thesis. Is this thesis open to the criticism, widespread in post moderern and post colonial theory, that characterizing societies as a form of essentializing distortion, assuming uniformity and denying the humanity of the members of that society? The post colonial argument set forth in Edward say he's groundbreaking orientalism that people are really more or less the same, and that any distinction between cultures imposes a false essentialism aimed at defining certain populations as other, primarily to demean them and justify imperial and colonial oppression. Rashionally dismissed culture as of nugatory significance. The assumption that all people are just like us is a kind of ethnocentrism that projects our values, our ways of thinking, and our goals onto other peoples. The anthropological study of culture around the world is based on a recognition of cultural differences, on an appreciation of the importance of culture in people's lives, and on respect for other people's cultures. The postcoloonial argument that knowledge of other cultures is impossible because people and cultures do not exhibit uniformity jumps from a known fact to a false inference. All knowledge is based on abstraction, and abstraction draws commonalities and averages that exist beyond the acknowledged variation of the particulars. For example, there are different species and varieties of camel, but we would not therefore conclude that we cannot validly distinguish camels from horses. Tents, too, are different from one another in materials used and in structure, and yet tents are not houses, and the differences are fairly obvious. As regards cultures, there are variations both between and within arab and middle eastern cultures. But anyone who argues on that basis that it is impossible to distinguish arab culture from hindu culture would not be being frank. He talks too, that there are like, there are pros and cons to different types of arrangements depending upon, you know, what a particular culture allows. I'll just read this for a quick second. One important consequence of reliance on balanced opposition is an emphasis on individual independence, freedom and responsibility, and also on equality and democracy. At the same time, the military virtues of prowess and courage and the goal of domination are highly valued. The reasons for this are a decentralized system of defense based upon self help, such as balanced opposition, relies on each individual to make judgments and act his own. On his own or freely in collaboration with his fellow group members. Acting in defense and retaliation means engaging in violence for which skill and courage are desirable. In tribal societies based on balanced opposition, male children are raised to be independent, to take responsibility for themselves, and to be ready and able to engage in sanctioned violence against designated enemies. Collected decisions about action are made democratically in councils in which all group members are free to speak. No mechanisms of coercion are available to force group members to act. Collective agreement on decisions puts moral pressure on each individual to fulfill his duty and his reputation and honor are at stake. But ultimately it is up to each individual to decide an act. The honorable man has no ruler and bows to no man, but stands on his own feet and his own reputation as an equ equal to others. So he goes on'like there's pros and cons, different things. Like, just because you're talking about another society or another culture doesn't mean you have to say that that culture is wholly bad or that you're demeaning them or otherwizing them. And sometimes, depending on where you go in the world, it could be important to recognize that there are different cultural aspects to different people that cause them to act or to accept or reject things in different ways. I'm sorry, I'm only bringing this up because this statement of like, well, why would you not like this culture or these two groups of people clashing? Everybody can be just like us in America is not true. There are different cultures that exist in different parts of the world for different reasons and they've got different proclivities. The statement that she's saying is she's so fucking stupid. It's so clueless. You've ever been to any other place in the world and you step outside of like a tourist trap, where you step outside of like the most friendly english speaking area that you can.

There was a very passionate desription having.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Them on the brink of famine and start, by the way, I don't know if I'll go over it, but there's another thing. I think the UN, I believe I've only headlined in one paragraph to this so I say this cautiously. I might read this. Im probably read offream. I think the UN has completely walked back the IPC class ##ifications on the starvation stuff. I think they tossed all of it. I think they tossed all of it saying that there wasn't good data to support any of those conclusions. IPC O was it this posted June 8 famine review committee review of the Famine early warning Systems Network IPC compatible analysis for the northern governance the Gaza Strip conclusions and recommendations we won't read this whole thing, just the main conclusions of the FRC are summari to table one. ThEC would like to use this opportunity to communicate two extremely important points. Firstly, all stakeholders who use the IPC for high level decision making must understand that whether a famine classification is confirmed does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip and does not in any manner change the immediate humanitarian imperative to address the civilians this civilian suffering by enabling complete, safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities. All actors should not wait until a famine classification for the current period is made to act accordingly. Secondly, the EFFSC would like to highlight that that the very fact that we are unable to endorse or not few s sn net's analysis is driven by the lack of essential up to date data on human well being in northern Gaza and Gaza at large. Thus, the EFFC strongly requests all parties to enable humanitarian access in general and specifically to provide a window of opportunity to conduct field surveys in northern Gazaa more solid evidence of the food consumption nriion mortality situation. My understanding is they basically said that, well, actually I don't think we have. Fuck, I should just read this instead of just giving the summaries from unit of analysis northern governance t one okay, key conclusions the FRC does not find the fews net analysis plausible given the uncertainty and lack of convergence of the supporting evidence employed in the analysis. Therefore, ThERC is unable to make a determination as to whether or not famine thresholds have been passed during April. As the EVERC does not find the fuse net analysis plausible for the current period, THEC is unable to endorse the IPC phase five classification for the projection period. However, this fusede net projection is in line with the FRICC projection done in March 2024, which has not yet been updated. So when you heard people saying that there are more starving gossms today than there are starving people in the entire rest of the world. That's the statements that they're referring to where they're saying actually we can't really validate any of that. We don't really have the data for any of that analysis. That was the IPC phase five classification that was projected here. This is pretty short. The Fewsnet food availability analysis excludes the contribution of commercial and or privately contracted deliveries, potentially between 1000 hundred 20 metric tons of food on the low side and 3850 metric tons of food on the high side in the month of March and about 2400 to 4000 metric tons of food in the month of April. While the intervals are extremely wide, indicative of a high level of uncertainty, this corresponds to the potential exclusion of about 25% to 76% coverage of the daily kilocalorie requirements in March and 34% to 82% in April. So from their analysis they were excluding food that could have on the high end accounted for 76% or 82% of the required caloric intake. Even a conservative approach towards the commercial and or privately contracted food deliveries to northern Gaza, which the FRC consider as possible, would still indicate a contribution of 25% to 34% coverage of the daily kilocalorie requirement in March and April, respectively. That's on the lower bounds. This is not this is crazy guys. The food availability analysis excludes the contribution of WFP deliveries to bakeries in northern Gaza. What is WFP? World Food Program I think deliveries to bakeries in northern Gaza, including reported 940 m. Wait, was that megatons or metric to, I'm sorry, not megatonss metric tons of flour, sugar, salt and yeast in April. While the intervals are extremely wide, indicative of high level uncertainty. This corresponds to the potential exclusion of about four to 15% coverage of the daily koccoie requirement. The fusede net food availability analysis attributed a value of 3640 calories per kilogram of unspecified WFP food assistance delivered by trucks and 2657 calories for unspecified food assistance delivered by airdrops as well. For maritime deliveries, the everca estimates of those values could be significantly higher or significantly lower. Similarly, views net estimated the composition of non us airdrops, including 70% percent food, which could be significantly higher or lower. The Everse finds the last assumption above to be conservative, though plausible. However, the exclusion of all commercial and or privately contracted deliveries and WFP deliveries of flour, sugar, yeast and salt to bakeries translates to the exclusion of food equal to as much as 38% to 49% coverage of the daily caloric requirements in April, while Fuznet estimated the caloric availability in the area as covering only 59% to 63% of the needs based uniquely on humanitarian food assistance. In April. The review done by the FRC estimates that this range would be 75% to 109% if commercial and or privately contracted food deliveries were included, 157% if a higher estimate was used. It is possible and likely that a vast part of these commercial and or privately contracted deliveries was and remains diffic to access, especially for the most vulnerable. However, the FRSC finds unlikely that the totality of these supplies was and remains completely inaccessible to the population. The FRC notes that foosnet does not present up to date data or evidence for April from standardized indicators for food consumption and livelihood change derived from survey methods such as the food consumption score, household hunger scale, or other indicators found in the IPC reference table. While IPC protocols do allow for the utilization of data that is not necessarily up to date, it must be interpreted for its relevance to current status analysis by considering the highly dynamic situation. The Foosnet analysis utilizes survey data on food consumption collected two months before April, together with more recent, though incomplete, contributing factor analysis of availability and access to food. The pre April period reflects conditions when food availability was at one of its lowest points, with only nine to 15% of daily kilocalorie needs met. This is the period where observed extremely high levels of food insecurity far surpassed the IBC famine threshold for food consumption. While an updated outcome analysis employing households economy approach is provided by Foo't, the modeling incorporates data inputs from months prior to April that may not fully reflect the conditions in April given the highly dynamic situation. So it sounds like what they were doing. I'm extrapolating from I'm inferencing and extrapoling. From what I've read, it sounds like they were doing is they were saying basically they were taking the time period right after the war started when basically everything was cut and they were basically saying like okay, well we're going to pretend that this is all the food going in. We're going to project this forward and use that essentially, which seems a little bit wacky. Read the second paragraph on page five on this page five on the PDF page five or the document page five. What's a real bummer is that you'd think people would be happy to hear the Palestinians are not starving on masse, but I have a feeling it's considered bad news for palestinian ##ig against OSHA. While the analysis conduct during the review, estimates of the percentage of the calorie requirements met are higher than that of the foos net. The lower foos net estimates do suggest two key points. One, that there was a significant increase in food availability from February to March to April, and second, that nearly 100% of daily calorie requirements were available for the estimated population of 300,000 people in April, even using conservative calculations. Wait, who are these 300,000 people? Are those the 300,000 that were said to be living in IPC five cate in the IPC five category? Wait, that can't possibly be the case. I can't be reading that correctly because if that's correct, that means that even using conservative estimates, that that report was a complete and total boldfaced fucking lie. How many people were said to be living in IPC five? The current one they had was 677,000 listed here. This is for the estimated population. They say 300,000 here. I wonder what the 300,000 here is talking about. But this is saying that while the analysis conducted during the review estimates that the percentages of caloric requirements met are higher than that of the foos net, the lower foos net estimates. The lower estimates suggest two key points. The lower estimate one, that there was a significant increase in food availability from February to March to April, and two, that nearly 100% of daily caloric requirements were available for the estimated population of 300,000 people in April, even using conservative calculations. So this was saying that 677,000 people were living in phase five. IPC phase five, which counts as what is the definition of IPC? IPC phase five is defined as households have an extreme lack of food and or other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategy. Starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. For famine classification, area needs to have extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition and mortality. Famine is a classification of IPC phase five at area level in a given area, famine occurs when food security, nutrition and mortality altogether portray famine conditions, meaning that at least 20% of the population is affected, with about one out of three children being acutely malnourished and two people dying per day for every 10,000 inhabitants due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease. So 10,000 inhabitants go with. We'll just go with half the population of Gaza. So 1 million people div divided by 10,000 divided by two. So that means that 50 people per day should be dying of starvation. So for one month we would have expected to see 1500 people dying of starvation, the highest number I ever saw was 27. And I don't believe anybody's reporting that number anymore. The 300,000 is a population of northern Gaza, not the whole strip, which is what the report focuses on. Okay, but I think the northern part is supposed to theoretically be the worst part anyway, right? So wait, times two. Not divided by two. Wait, did I that up? Two people dying for every 10,000 inhabitants. So for every 10,000 inhabitants. Oh, times two. Oh, I'm sorry. So it should have been 6000 people dying of starvation per month. I wonder if they say anything about deaths. TheRc considers that the scenario and assumptions developed for the evolution of the crude death rate and under five death rate are not supported by the available evidence for the current period of analysis. It appears instead plausible that the steep increase in deaths due to malnutrition and or dehydration that was reported by the Ministry of Health in March did not continue at the same rate into April. What was the deaths due to maltrition or dehydration that was reported by the Ministry of Health in March? What were these deaths? Did they cite these? I couldn't find any amount of starvation deaths. Gaza. I think I saw. I thought I saw 27 was confirmed by some organization. This says 37. Just there. Only 37 people died of. Who are we sourcing? A and b quoting to CNN the true number of dead people. Conservation may already be higher as limited access to northern Gaza has hindered the ability of to fully assess the situation there. Two and one child dies of malnutrition and dehydration. Report we have an Algeazeera source. June 1, supported by Waffa news agency. A 13 year old palestinian child has died due to malnutrition deterioration in Aloxarrs hospital in dear al Balah in central Gaza, Wafa news agency has reported. Where is the 37 number? Child dies of malnutrition and dehydration a and b. The second source here is newborns die of hunger and mothers struggle to feed their children at Israel. Seeiege condems Godsaa starvation again, I don't like to. It sounds so heartless and cruel and evil and I don't mean to sound that way, but like this woman is not emaciated. How did her child die of starvation? I don't what's happening? Am I misunderstand? I say I misunderstanding something to try to be humble, but like this doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's an old picture, like this woman, at least from her face she doesn't look emaciated, had a seven year old daughter had a seven year old child die of starvation. My daughter moved to God's mercy because of the lack of calcium, potassium and oxygen, she told seen on Monday. Suddenly everything dropped because she was not eating anything with iron or eggs. She used to eat eggs every day before the war. Now nothing. She passed away. This sounds like, this doesn't, this doesn't sound like a starvation death. What are we talking about? This doesn't sound like at least 15 children and northern Guaz that have died from dehydration and malnutrition. A palestinian ministryive health spokesperson said Sunday also. I'm so sorry, but like, what is this? The medical worker told CNN that patients in the intensive care and neonatal units were dying from malnutrition and a lack of oxygen. The UN figure is 32 as of six days ago. Oh, okay. I thought they stopped reporting it at all, but now they. But they're still reporting 32. Wait, this is from. Oh, June we'in. June, the UN health agency reported 32 deaths for malnutrition. It's like, tragic. It is just tragic. Like the reporting on here. Like what? Like even knowing what the f is happening is hard to understand. It is possible that deaths were occurring where households were sheltering rather than in health facilities, precluding the recording and reporting of these deaths. Repeated attacks on and around health facilities during or shortly before the current analysis period may well have increased people's reluctance to attend health facilities and impacted the functionality of these facilities. This would have in turn increased likelihood deaths would have remainedport unreported. However, there remains considerable uncertainty by the deathll in northern Gaza during this period, particularly for non trauma mortality and uncertainty that will only be overcome when adequate humanitarian access is allowed to permit the implementation of a comprehensive survey. Have they dropped all the IPC five projections then for the Gaza Strip then? Has it been completely dropped or. This is wild. Okay, sorry. Anyway, that's where they're at for that.\n",

      "Destiny: When people, when she advocates for the destruction of Israel, that's fine, because remember, when these people say one state solution, they mean one state solution with an unlimited right of return. Right now, there are about 7 million jewish people. I believe it's about 7 million jewish people live in Israel. There's about 2 million Palestinians that live in Israel. There's about 3 million that live in the West bank, and there's about 2 million that live in the Gaza Strip. I think there's about 7 million jewish people, there's about 7 million Palestinians, and there's about 6 million palestinian refugees. So if you brought them all back, it would be about 7 million Jews, it'd be about 13 million Palestinians. That's the one state that these people are always advocating for.

      "Destiny: All who is in charge of Palestine Hamas. Why does it feel like there are no names when it comes to leadership? I don't know. Because they just have no agency. Nobody really gives them any agency. When you're talking about the Gaza Strip, I believe there's generally three names that are associated with major leadership. There is Ismail Haan. I can't pronounce this guy's fucking name. This guy is considered the, I believe this guy would be considered the, is it, do they call it the politburo? But this is like the big guy for Hamas. This is like their big head leader dude who spends most of his time, I believe, living in Qatar. I'm pretty sure you have, what is Sinwar's first name? So this is one guy. Oay ha. You've got Sinwar, Yaya Sinwar, who's considered to be like the leader of the Gaza Strip. This is the leader of the Gaza Strip who's a member of Hamas. And then you've got, as part of Hamas, the military arm is called al Qasem Brigades. No, that's, yes, yes. As a Dean al Qan brigades, people just call them Alkassan brigades or Alkass and, or whatever. And this is headed by Mohammad de. I think, I don't know what this guy looks like, but I think these would be like the three biggest players, I believe. When it comes to talking about the Gaza Strip, I don't know what the name, who's the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad? Fuck me. I don't know who the name of the head is. Ziad al Nakala. I've never, I don't ever hear this guy brought up. And then their arm is called alcutts brigades. I don't know who they, they'spokesman is Abu Hamzah. I dont know. But I think those are the three Hamas leaders that if you want to be familiar with any leadership, those are the three that I see reference sometimes, but international, we just dont talk about them because Hamas and them have no agency. I guess I dont know why all.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny: One of the biggest kill shots, in my opinion, to that would be if you want to see a world where everybody can live together peacefully, you arguably can look at a microcosm of the aloxic compound or the Temple mount. When Muslims control the Temple Mount, Jews aren't even able to pray at the western wall. I don't believe when Jews are in control of the Temple Mount, Muslims are allowed to go into alakqs and mosque, Jews are allowed to pray the western wall. I think Christians are allowed to visit more or less everybody kind of can. So if you want to talk about, like, everybody able to live together and play peacefully, it seems like it happens a little bit nicer under jewish control than it does under muslim control. Not to say that it's perfect right now, obviously people have issues with the IDF going into, you know, into al Axa and, you know, cracking skulls or whatever like this. But just saying that in general, under jewish control, it seems to play a little bit better destiny. Israel doesn't control al Aqxa. Jordan does. I mean, kind of. So for holy sites in Israel and in the West Bank, I think you have it called, it's called the Wa. There are these like, trustees that kind of administrate these areas. And for the Temple Mount Fe Axa compound, I think that the wake, the WAC, whatever the fuck it's called, is Jordan right now. But I mean, like, that's only happening because the territory is under israeli control, right? It's not like Jordan has conquered that area or something. It's because Israel has allowed Jordan to have administrative control over it while they more or less rule the territory. But.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: What, what's upunately that place exists. It's called Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Okay, he should. I feel like using the example of the compound is better to look at that, analyze that as a microcosm or to ask the question how many Jews live under. How many Jews live in any arab majority countries? I think there's like one. I think it's like Morocco. I think has Jews. Or is it Tunisia? No, I think it's Morocco. I think this is the biggest jewish community in the world in any arab state outside of Israel. Well Israel is not an arab state. Theres like 2500 that live there. Iran has Jews. Wait, how many live in Iran? Iran. Jewish population. Oh, Iran has 10,000 Jews. Where the fuck do these live in? Oh they live in Tehran. O never mind. There you go. Iran. Is it too. Tunisia, jewish population 1500. Iran technically is'an arab state. Just a muslim state though. But the Iran numbers are pretty controversial.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: We should think about a world where Arabs and Muslims and Jews can live together in a peaceful civil society. But fortunately that place exists. It's called Israel. Now my solution is very similar to Michaels. There are times in history when a particular group suffers such a massive military defeat that it creates ripples of discrediting of this kind of approach. And there needs to be a kind of receckkon for Palestinians to give up on their hundred year delusion that their freedom and that their sovereignty depends on the elimination of Israel. And I know that you are coming, Brianna, from a very good place where you say, well, everybody should live in peace in one state from the river to the sea. But in fact what you're doing is you're feeding the delusion that's only going to get more Palestinians killed.\n",

      "Destiny: I don't think this guy's made the best arguments or even the best 's like history of analysis, but 100% agree with this conclusion here. Obviously it's not. The international pressure from both ends on Israel is largely negative, I think, and is feeding delusions on both sides. Sometimes it's not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: What friends of Palestinians should say is very simply, this is never going to happen. You're not going to eliminate Israel except half a loaf. And Israel changes on a dime. They, they have elections, it seems every three months. So the point is, and by the way, the last government before this one had for the first time an arab party in the ruling coalition. There are Arab Supreme Court justices so if there was a viable palestinian leader that said, all right, let's do it, let's negotiate a deal, I am sure the Israelis would say, great, because they just want to get on with their lives like so many other people in.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny: Okay, do you think they have one airpod in each ear because they're sharing one brain between both of them or.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: We're gonna talk a lot about the numbers later in the video. But given that this is gonna be a huge part of the entire first half of the debate, I just want to make sure to say at least some things about it now. So the Wall Street Journal reports that United States intelligence has confidence in Theaza Ministry of Health's numbers. They use it in their own briefings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: The I abuse tactic. Do we do the. I'm just kidding. This is. I I. I can't. I. Everyone watch this. I already know what he's gonna do. I can already tell. The specific claim was that the current numbers have been revised down. That's true. I already read two articles, by the way. This is not contested. The current numbers have been revised down. You saying that in the past these numbers have been reliable is not a counter to the claim. It's not a rejection or a refutation of the argument. The current numbers have been revised down. Are you about to just give the.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: Historical numbers has confidence in the Gaza ministry of Health's numbers. They use it in their own briefings. The us assistant secretary of state said further that the actual death toll may likely be higher. And in israeli magazine, M. Comeomt reported that israeli intelligence sources concluded that the Gaza Ministry of health numbers are, quote, generally reliable and they use them in their own briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: So that goes. You're using a general reliability as a refutation of a specific claim. Your honor, my client is being accused of rape. My client is 30 years old. Generally he hasn't raped anyone. Generally, he doesn't spend the vast majority of his time raping people. 35 years of existence, in basically every single part of his life. In almost all of his life. He's not raping anybody. Your honor, this isn't. This isn't even a. Even if what you're saying is true, it doesn't refute the claim that the current numbers have been revised downwards. And if this is a five hour video and they've got 140 sources. So right now I'm treating them as idiots. But they're not idiots. Okay? They're not idiots. They're malevolent. They're evil. Because if they really, truly spent 5 hours on this video and if they really, truly googled around and put all this research together, then they would have come across the fact that the numbers were revised downwards. I'm willing to bet that if I were to google. Gaza deaths revised UN revises death toll for women and children why is the UN citing lower death toll for women and children. Here's the real problem with the UN's revised Gaza. Gaza government says, oh, this is 47 franc ago. Why UN lowered Gaza death toll for women and children. Gaza death tol UN says numbers of deaths remains unchanged after controversy over revised data. Will they at least respond to this? Because if you google it, you immediately see it, and you guys have 140 some sources. So if you google it, you immediately see this claim. Are you going to respond to something specific or are we just gonna make.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: The general claim goes completely against the propaganda that you keep hearing that. Oh, if you trust Israel, how could you possibly trust these Gaza Ministry of health numbers? You know, they're all from Hamas. Israel has no way of tracking these numbers themselves. They're not collecting all the bodies like the Gaza ministry of Health is. They're able to maybe do some like really rough estimates, but they trust that the Gaza ministry of Health is the most generally reliable source that they have access to. And Vice Michael Moynihan's former employer further validated MkCoick magazines reporting and found the same thing from israeli intelligence sources. Further, that same vice report found that NATO also considers the Gaza Ministry of Health numbers accurate and uses them in their own briefings. So basically the entire west trusts these numbers. Israel trusts these numbers. You don't have to trust hamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: So they're not going to refer to that downward revision. They're just going toa pretend it doesn't even exist. They're not even go goingna say it particular. They're not going to say anything about it. They're just gonna trust that these are.\n",
      "\n",

      "E: It'S going to be brutal and it's deeply unfortunate. There are, of course, rules of war, and I suppose we can discuss in bigger detail of how that's being engaged right now. And I think that's the question. That is the hottest question.\n",

      "B: And we will get to the question, Eli.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: Well, I think we should start, I mean, a lot of talking point you'hear on the left usually is the war didn't start on October 7, and that's true. So we should look at the five, six previous skirmishes or wars or rocket wars, whatever you would call them, and ask the question, why didn't Israel finish off Hamas? They haven't changed. And the reason is because they understood that Hamas fights in such a despicable way as to maximize the civilian casualties on their own side. We all know we've heard this before, that they will launch rockets from schools and mosques and so forth. But there was always was known to the Israelis, in fact, it was known to human rights organizations, it was known to news agencies for many years that the headquarters of Hamas Q and brigades, their military wing, was under the largest hospital in Gaza. Who does such a thing unless there'a deliberate strategy to both maximize civilian casualties on your adversary side as well as.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: The okay, hold on. I'mnna guess, doing a big guess here. Hopefully I'm totally wrong and it'll be out other dumb shit. I wonder if they're go going to respond to this entire point by rolling the video of Israel showing one of the tunnels underneath the hospital saying, wow, this was the command center. That's all they showed. And they're go goingna everything else said here just kind of that one video but, or refer to that video but maybe not. Let's see what else he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: People you purport to govern. Now, the atrocities committed on October 7 were just so inhumane and so barbaric and savage that it left Israel no choice but to confront this dilemma that had been dealing with for the past 17 years. It has to destroy this organization despite the fact that it has spent nearly two decades building up an infrastructure, I might add, with aid provided that was supposed to go to the people of Gaza to build and entire underground city just for its fighters and commanders so that they can be safe as Israel retaliates for the atrocities committed by Hamas. So when you are dealing with such a stark choice, thus there are going to be civilian casualties because the army, the military that is usually supposed to protect those civilian casualties would rather sacrifice them for a pr victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: None of this is contested. Hamas doesn't contest this, okay? Hamas doesn't deny any of this kind of simple thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "D: So back to your question. Is it a just war? It absolutely is a just war. But it' more than just a just war. It's a necessary war. Because what Israel must do in eliminating Hamas is to show to every other dirtbag islamist terrorist group and nation state like Iran that this tactic of fighting wars will not prevail. Because if Hamas survives, then you will better believe that the next wars that are fought by various kinds of fanatical terrorist groups will continue to learn from their tactics. So in my view, it's an easy question. Of course it's a just war. It's a necessary war. And when Israel finishes, hopefully Barra Hasem and Hamas is no more. They oughta win a Nobel Peace prize.\n",

      "G: But, you know, I think that's a little wild. Okay. So of substance, a couple things to talk about in that section, one of them being the claims of Hamas using human shields. So that's just like, a little bit misleading. So I want to clarify. Was actually happening when people say that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: Oh, boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: So there's no evidence that Hamas forces civilians to stay in certain locations for their military goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: The Finkelstein SL kind of Amnesty International talking point, I'm guessing this mainly comes from Finkelstein. One, there has been evidence that Hamas has told civilians not to flee in recent. In this recent war, number one. But number two, human shields don't require you to force civilians sustain an area. It only requires the co location of civilians, military objects for the purposes of gaining an advantage. So firing rockets from schools and mosques and homes would count as utilizing human shields because you're hoping that your opponent won't attack those areas, because if they do, they're going toa be in big trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: It'way to, like, you know, disincentivize israeli attack. There's been allegations of this that have gone around. You know, I've seen, like, little videos trending on Twitter and people saying, like, oh, they're blocking people from going someplace. Yeah, but this has, like, never been validated by anyone independent. And, you know, we wouldn't have know where we are right now. People have. Some people have moved out of Rafa because they're attacking Rafa, but, you know, they wouldn't have all like, clustered in Rafa to be safe if they were being blocked from going there. So that, you know, that basic fact alone kind of points against the narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: How about the fact that a Rafa. How about the fact that a camp outside of Rafa just had 50 some people die as it was set on fire because of a camp that was set up right next to a massive munitions factory that showed an actual fucking. Was it a mortar launcher sitting like meters outside of a tent? Like, we literally saw a video of this, like a couple weeks ago. We literally saw right next to it. What do we consider that we just had a huge event that happened like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "G: When the ICC, the International Criminal Court, dropped their charges against Hamas leaders and also Netanyahu in the charges against MusL leaders, they included a bevy of war crimes, right? And using human shields in an act of, like, you know, like we are intentionally placing them in harm's way sort of definition. That is a war crime. And they investigated this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: I don't remember reading that. Is human shields a war crime? I don't even think human shields have an international definition. It's considered part of customary international law that you can't use human shields. I know that actually. No, wait, I'm sorry. No, I don't even think that's considered. You're not supposed to do it because it's kind of a contravention of other agreements. But human. I don't believe human shields. Candy, point this to me. In the Rome Statute, there's not many we can look at what.\n",

Willfully causing great suffering, extensive destruction and appropriation of property. Compelling a prisoner of war or other protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power. Willfully depriving a prisoner of war, other protected person of the rights affair and regular trial, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement, taking of hostages there.

Xx oh. Utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations. Oh. This would be considered the human shield part, but we know that there's like, this is like uncontested that Hamas has done this. Even Amnesty International. I have this for my debate prep for Finkelstein because I only, I tried to only use the. I tried to only use their sources, or sources that they would accept. This is in the, the 2009 report. 2009 report. This is just for Castat. This isn't even for any of the conflicts afterwards. Hamas and other palestinian armed groups also violated international medne law in their conduct within Gaza, they launched rockets and located military equipment an Ntyon International July 2000 920 days of death destruction oh, I must have copied the tit here. They launched rockets and located military equipment and positions near civilian homes, endangering the lives of the inhabitants by exposing them to the risk of israeli attacks. They also used empty homes and properties as combat positions during armed confrontations with israeli forces, exposing the inhabitants of nearby houses to the danger of attacks or being caught in the crossfire. And this is just one Amnesty International report. Like, this is just, this is going by the most biased on, like, their side. Again, like, this isn't even contested. Like, even international human rights groups won't contest this. Really. They might contest, like, the exact usage of the word human shield while going on to describe what would be considered human shields. But it's just, this isn't even, like, a contested thing.\n",

      "G: Is the soul. Okay, but it's specifically jihadists saying this to strike fear in their opponents. Okay, you can't then take that and impute that. Yeah, you can't even impute that to all of Hamas. Like, it's just the soldiers, right? Like, but you certainly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny: Oh, my God, the Hannibal directive. This amorphous thing that is, I don't think has ever manifested in all the fucking israeli military history that people claim happened on October 7, where Israel will kill as many of their civilians as possible to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy. They'll kill as many ways as possible. By the way, the same retarded fuck country that traded one soldier for, like, fucking 2000 palestinian fucking prisoners. What the fuck was this guy's name? U. I don't even. How many people do they trade for this fucking dude? No offense, I. Man, I hope this guy's living a good ass life right now. Jesus Christ. 1027 palestinian prisoners were released, some of who were convicted on multiple murders and carrying ant attacks. Israeli civilians.\n",

      "\n",
      "G: And there's been apparently, like, different interpretations of it at various times and amongst different military members. But it's a directive that says something along the lines of, rather than letting Israelis be taken captive'kill, all of them to shoot in their direction, even if it risks killing them. So, you know, here's one quote. You could totally make a misrepresentation, like, this way that is, you know, one statement of version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: You're talking about a theoretical doctrine that you don't even have any evidence of existing in any hardline way. That's talked about in different ways by different members in the military that you don't even know has s ever been applying. You're comparing that to the fucking slogan of the Hamas military? Your. That's your comparison.\n",

      "G: The Hannibal direct, which is in 2011, there was a televised briefing of a military commander before entering Gaza for an operation. And what he said in this briefing on television was, no soldier from the 51st battalion can be kidnapped. A soldier should detonate his hand grenade and blow himself up with the person trying to abduct him.\n",

Very hard to do that. So now it is true, of course, to give kind of like, I know.\n",

      "Destiny: It wasn't great, but didn the new UN report say something about 14 people being killed via Hannibal directive? It did. It listed that in there. It said 14 people were killed, possibly because of the Hannibal directive. I tried to search for, like, what the fuck? Is there evidence for that in there? And they have nothing. They just say that unless somebody has some other sourcer quote for that, I have no idea why that wound up in there because they listed in, they'like, oh, that's kind of weird. But then I don't see a single. I don't see any idea. Oh, hold on. Somebody linked it. The commission is aware of allegations that the ISF used the Hannibal directive to prevent the capture of israeli civilians in their transfer to Gaza, even at the cost of killing them. Such allegations were made in relation to ISF actions in the Nova site, including reports of ISF attack helicopter shooting at israeli civilian cars, resulting in the deaths or the killings of Israel. The commission confirmed the presence of at least eight attack helicopters in various locations on October 7, but it could not confirm that they shot at civilians or civilian cars, including the areas of the festival. The commission documented one statement by an ISF tank crew confirming that the crew had applied the Hannibal directed by shooting at a vehicle which they suspected was transporting abducted ISF soldiers. The commission also verified information indicating that in at least two other cases, ISF had likely applied the Hannibal directive, resulting in the killing of up to 14 israeli civilians. One woman was killed by ice of helicopter firewall being abducted from near Oz to Gaza by militants. In another case, the commission found that israeli tank fire killed some or all of the 13 civion hostages held in a house. And beree, I don't know where they get the source for this Hannibal directive was applied and it wasn't just them fighting with or exchanging fire with. I don't wa want to say hamas. I guess whatever militants were. I don't know what the source is for this. If anybody has any idea or wants to link it or has some kind of sorcerer, I'd be curious. But I have no idea what the source is for this statementd. If anybody wants to shoot me. A link to that. If there's anything out there. Yeah.\n",

      "G: The other side that Hamas does fight from civilian locations. And, you know, I'm not justifying like it's really bad because it does contribute to the huge number of civling casualties, but it's also kind of hard for them to do anything else because Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. It says densely pop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny: This is. But they. They don't even have a uniform, so it's so densely populated, they can't even wear military uniforms. Okay. I mean, we're not sitting 5 hours on this. I realized I understand why this guy is so educated, though. Somebody like this. History speaks. And I are developing a podcast series covering the entire israeli palestinian conflict from origins to present.\n",
